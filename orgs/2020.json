Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.\nSome of our software projects are enviroCar, 52°North SOS, 52°North JavaScript Sensor Web Client, ILWIS, and 52°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Ohloh page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, WaterInnEU, ODIP II).\nAll of the 52°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.\n52°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.</p>\n",

In order to deal with time intervals of clips/sequences it makes sense to have operators that help with temporal reasoning. Such operators have been given by James F. Allen. The core OTIO API is written in C++. A lot of other higher level languages are popular for tooling. Many such languages (such as Lua, Go, Ruby, etc) are not directly compatible with C++ but have ways to interact with a C-API. So it would help if we have a C wrapper for OTIO. Java is one of the most versatile languages, also powering one of the most pervasive platforms - Android. Mobile Computing is becoming more powerful and widespread by the day. Having Java bindings will help us get OTIO support to all the Java compatible platforms.</p>\n",

One of the most important parts of an end to end small satellite business is ground-based tracking. Satellite tracking provides valuable information on the whereabouts with the use of large antennas and high power transmitters at the price of expense and lead time.</p>\n<p>It is thus important to use an alternative tracking method, for example, Doppler Tracking. Doppler based orbit determination uses a doppler frequency shift to convert to a distance problem. Then, orbits may be directly fitted to the Doppler data in a trial and error fashion, but a much less laborious way of computing is to differentially correct an initial approximation of the orbit. This way the cost of the tracking system is kept low because equipment needs beyond the essential receiver are small, at a minimum consisting of an amplifier and a variable oscillator.</p>\n<p>So through this project, the goal is to determine the orbit of active satellites using Doppler shift by implementing an algorithm and simulate the final results.</p>\n",

The catalog information can be augmented by the observations taken not only by high-end designated tracking assets, but also by cost-effective consumer-level sensors. \nWhile lacking high sensitivity, these sensors can still be used to perform uncued Initial Orbit Determination. Recently, in addition to electro-optical sensors, the appearance of low-cost Software-Defined Radios made it possible to deploy low-cost passive radar tracking stations. By using a network of such stations it might render possible to create and maintain an open-source orbiting object catalog.

However, the current AFL++ does not support grammar and therefore struggles with highly-structured inputs like PHP, JavaScript, or HTML . Although AFL++ allows users to define a dictionary, including language keywords, to help generate inputs, it still lacks more structured descriptions of the underlying syntax.</p>\n<p>To tackle the existing limitations of AFL++, the main goal of this project is to develop a pluggable grammar mutator that is integrated with AFL++’s mutation engine and can efficiently generate grammar-aware inputs. On one hand, like Nautilus, we want to combine grammar mutators with AFL++’s mutation engine. Also, we want to avoid the potential limitation of Nautilus: “over time Nautilus de-generates to structure-unaware greybox fuzzing”, as indicated by AFLSmart paper. On the other hand, we want to generate test cases efficiently as F1 fuzzer. Furthermore, to improve usability, we will develop a program generator that takes the grammar model as input and generates a mutator library, which is based on AFL++’s custom mutator APIs.</p>\n",

The categories such as gender, age, race, sexual orientation, physical/mental ability, socio economic, education, years of experience and religion, are used when getting information on user’s background.

Initially, I had envisioned the project with Flutter completely for cross-platform support as it suited the project idea. But along my way, working out the details and developing the sample prototype for the project idea, I got to know that ‘Landmark Detection’ from the Firebase Vision API in particular wasn’t yet supported with Flutter. To make it work, I needed to write quite good amount of native code for both Android and iOS platforms. If we were use to use on-device processing, that would make the app itself heavy since we would need to train our own custom ML model with a lot of data as an user can try to detect a monument from any angle possible. All these points, got me to reject the idea of Flutter for the complete app development. But at the same time, Flutter really has some great benefits such as extremely good UX/UI development, smooth performance, faster productive development, multiplatform support for future using same codebase. So I thought why not develop a native Android application and integrate Flutter with it for the frontend work and some backend work binding as well if needed.</p>\n",

In essence, each \n pair is visualized as a ‘vertex’ on a graph, with an ‘edge’ between vertices that exist as a translation on Apertium. By exploring this graph, new translations can be inferred. In particular, bilingual dictionaries can be generated for any two languages that do not have an existing language pair but independently exist on Apertium.</p>\n<p>It is notable that polysemy diminishes the use of a simple transitive relation.

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a> (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Blender, Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>appleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&amp;D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).</p>\n<p>In October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.</p>\n",

Normal maps are textures that are efficient for introducing spatial variational detail on smooth geometry. Information from the normal map, in current shading point, can be used to define either shading normal of meso-surface or microsurface profile of microfacet bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In this project, we will implement a method from Schüssler et al.  \"Microfacet-based normal mapping for robust Monte Carlo path tracing\" which tackles with microfacet based normal mapping. The result of this method enables us to use arbitrary normal maps and BRDFs for defining the microfacet BRDF for the whole surface. Important properties of the introduced microfacet BRDF are energy conservation, symmetry and discrete distribution of microsurface normals which preserves high-frequency detail.</p>\n",

You can tell your board what to do by sending a set of instructions to the microcontroller on the board. To do so you use the Arduino programming language (based on C++), and the Arduino Software (IDE or CLI tool).</p>\n<p>Over the years Arduino has been the brain of thousands of projects, from everyday objects to complex scientific instruments. A worldwide community of makers - tens of millions of students, hobbyists, artists, programmers, and professionals - has gathered around this open-source platform, their contributions have added up to an incredible amount of accessible knowledge that can be of great help to novices and experts alike.</p>\n<p>Arduino was born at the Ivrea Interaction Design Institute as an easy tool for fast prototyping, aimed at students without a background in electronics and programming. As soon as it reached a wider community, the Arduino board started changing to adapt to new needs and challenges, differentiating its offer from simple 8-bit boards to products for IoT applications, wearable, 3D printing, and embedded environments. All Arduino boards are completely open-source, empowering users to build them independently and eventually adapt them to their particular needs. The software, too, is open-source, and it is growing through the contributions of users worldwide.</p>\n",

Professional audio/video studios have to guarantee for small latencies when transmitting media signals between different devices.

Two of the high-level BioGears objectives are lowering the barrier to create medical training content and training the military. I believe that a clinically relevant comprehensive model of the naloxone reversal of fentanyl-induced respiratory depression could serve both as a training tool for emergency medical personnel as well as a predictive tool for the dose and frequency of nasally administered naloxone. Current guidelines for nasal naloxone usage are ambiguous and dependent on a wait-and-see approach instead of a high-fidelity data-driven predictive model, which risks under-usage of the life-saving drug due to basic human error.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Elastic deformation is an essential component of animation pipelines. Volumetric soft body simulation can be used to capture the complex details of muscle and skin, e.g. volume preservation under collision/compression. In visual effects, such methods must also be robust to extreme deformation (no numerical blow-ups) and fast enough for interactive manipulation. Moreover, many of the underlying material models are nonlinear and computationally expensive, such as hyper-elastic models for realistic tissue or artistically-defined deformation. Toward these challenges I propose the implementation of a volumetric soft body solver in Blender, that is not only rapid and robust, but is general to hyper-elastic materials. The solver will also be capable of robustly resolving self-collisions and possibly other constraints. This would greatly improve the use of physics in Blender for animation pipelines.</p>\n",

OpenSCAD at its core uses CGAL for geometry evaluation and OpenCSG and OpenGL for rendering. \n    OpenSCAD performs huge computations in the process of creating the required geometries. These geometries are stored in the cache for avoiding repetitive computations.  But this cache data is not persistent and destroys when the application closes. The goal of this project is to create a persistent cache system for OpenSCAD which uses a key-value datastore to store cache. This implementation will handle a cache similar to the existing one.</p>\n",

Besides not being elegant it brings many problems with it, like not being able to save the visualizations inside the notebook for sharing or bringing visual complexity of the entire GUI into the view instead of just displaying the 3D model. It is therefore important to find a way to visualize FreeCAD's 3D scene in the IPython display system as supported by Jupyter Notebook.</p>\n<p>Tackling the open issue “IPython / Jupyter support” I aim to implement a IPython compatible visualization of FreeCAD’s 3D Open Inventor scene graph. To achieve this I intend to choose a suitable JavaScript library able to render a 3D scene graph and to implement a mapping between it and the Open Inventor scene graph. After this as a byproduct I want to implement a better WebGL export based on the scene graph instead of document objects as currently found in FreeCAD. For this I can reuse and integrate the scene graph mapping component. Lastly I want to document the results in the Wiki and create an example Jupyter notebook.</p>\n",

The main advantage of long reads is that they span a much larger portion of the genome or transcriptome, making it easier to detect events such as structural variants or isoforms. As more researchers begin to take advantage of long reads, GenPipes needs to evolve and support long-read technology in its main pipelines.\n    The objective of this project is to create a new RNA-seq pipeline (rnaseq_longreads), that supports long-read inputs. The new pipeline will be created based on the current versions of the RNA-seq pipeline, with the addition of the minimap2 aligner as well as StringTie v2 and Ballgown for generating transcript counts.\n    In addition to implementing a long-read RNA-seq pipeline within the GenPipes framework, short-read RNA-seq pipeline will also be updated to utilize StringTie2 and both pipelines will be tested to ensure that they are working properly.</p>\n",

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.</p>\n<p>Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

The device orientation will be change on the basis of the user's choice.</li>\n<li>Google Sign-In and tagging: This will allow the user to sign-in to the Catrobat community with their google account along with their Catrobat account. I will integrate this feature using the google framework <code>GoogleSignIn</code>.</li>\n</ul>\n",

If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.</p>\n<p>While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.</p>\n<p>In addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: JokerTV integration, YouTube TV/Hulu support, AI, rclone, cloud, and a few more that are starting to take shape.</p>\n<p>The best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics &amp; technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.</p>\n<p>We’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 7th time.

The HEP Software Foundation (<a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/</a>) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, <a href=\"https://home.cern\" target=\"_blank\">https://home.cern</a>) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (<a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider</a>) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

Exposing the full shared library descriptors to the interpreter at runtime translates into an increased memory footprint. ROOT’s exploratory programming concepts allow implicit and explicit runtime shared library loading. It requires the interpreter to load the library descriptor. Re-parsing of descriptors’ content has a noticeable effect on runtime performance. \nC++ Modules are designed to minimize the reparsing of the same header content by providing an efficient on-disk representation of the C++ Code. C++ Modules have been implemented for Unix and OS X systems already and it is expected that with next release of ROOT, C++ modules will be default on OS X. This project aims to extend the C++ Modules support for Windows, by implementing compatible solutions to the UNIX baseline and also display corresponding performance results.</p>\n",

Current infrastructure still faces limitations to tackle the expected increase in data in terms of storage capacity and computation time. Early event reconstructions were based on matrix element methods followed by Monte Carlo techniques. Recent advances focused on boosting the speed of event simulations. For instance, C++ - based DELPHES uses simplified detector geometries and particle-material interactions, hence mapping the detector response into a parametric function. Nevertheless, this technique is limited by its exclusiveness to a specific detector geometry at a time, with any detector changes requiring the framework to be adjusted accordingly through hand-coding. Falcon (previously Turbosim), a fast stimulation framework that uses non-parametric methods to discern detector responses without the need for hand-coding. That being said, we aim to investigate the efficiency of deep generative models in simulating event reconstructions in a given detector, hence potentially replacing conventional complex algorithms.</p>\n",

This project aims to utilize CVMFS capabilities in podman workflow, to quickly load big scientific container images while maintaining the isolation and convenience of containers.</p>\n",

To move their large data around, CERN uses a service known as Rucio. In order for scientists to be able to perform analyses on Rucio-managed data using SWAN, it must be made accessible from within the notebook. This could be done in several ways, one of which is telling Rucio to replicate the requested data to a specific storage location. To do this, scientists must use Rucio CLI or web-based UI, which could be somewhat overwhelming for some. In addition to that, they must know which storage location the data must be replicated to, and the file path to access the data once replicated. Also, the path can change after sometime, forcing them to go through the process again.</p>\n<p>To address the issue, this project aims to develop a JupyterLab extension that integrates with Rucio.

It is concerned with the computation of topological invariants of curves on surfaces. The goal of this project is to add a new functionality to this package in order to decide if an input cycle on a given surface can be continuously deformed to a simple curve, i.e. a curve without self-intersection. The goal is to implement the algorithm described in this paper <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09327</a> (Computing the Geometric Intersection Number of Curves. Vincent Despré and Francis Lazarus. Journal of the ACM 66(6), Article 45, Nov. 2019.). The implementation will strongly rely on the current package functionality for the homotopy test.\nAnother interesting possibility could be to add a new functionality to this package in order to repair mesh surfaces that contain undesired non-trivial topology (small handles or tunnels). A first step is to compute a shortest cycle that is essential on a given surface, i.e. that is neither deformable to a point nor to a boundary cycle of the surface.

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting\nChapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the\ncloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed.\nChapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration\nwith academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique\nexperience for students to work on projects involving high-performance\ncomputing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel\nprovides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a\nseparate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism\nfeatures make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and\nprogram.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task\nwhich uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in\nperformance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that\nplacement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to\ninitially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until\nthey are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,\ntype inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or\nvice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Checker Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.</p>\n<p>Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count = \"hello\";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

This can be one of the reasons why CircuitVerse’s maximum traffic is from developed countries with above-average or good internet connectivity like the USA(26%), India(11%), UK(6%) and Canada(4%).

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>We are building a platform called <strong>EvalAI</strong> as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need for evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.</p>\n<p>The platform is used by more than 20 organizations from industry and academia such as Facebook, eBay, IBM, Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech, etc. It has hosted 50+ AI challenges with 5500+ users who have created 51000+ submissions. It has more than 90+ open-source contributors and 1.3M+ page views since its launch in 2017. Several research organizations like Mapiallary research, IBM research, etc. are using its forked version for hosting their internal challenges instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>\n",

It provides integrations to interact with various SCMs (Source Control Management Systems) and deliver the project source codes to production.\nThis project deals primarily to improve the integrations of various SCMs (Source Control Management Systems) in Screwdriver.cd. When developing pipelines for enterprise scale projects, it is imperative that a seamless interface is provided for interacting with private repositories in SCMs. Apart from this, enterprise projects feature pipelines built from multiple dependencies which have active development going on simultaneously. Therefore, it is important to ascertain that the CI/CD tooling works efficiently with these external SCM repositories. Hence, the two key areas where it will be improved are <strong>introduction of deployment keys for seamless handling of private repositories</strong> and <strong>triggering of builds from external SCM repositories</strong>.</p>\n",

With this feature, application live migration, snapshots, remote debugging, and many other things are possible.</p>\n<p>CRIU started as a sub-project of OpenVZ and grew with tremendous help from the community. It is currently packaged for many Linux distributions and is integrated into such projects as OpenVZ, Virtuozzo, LXC/LXD, Docker runc, Podman, and other software. It's a part of a container live migration tool called p.haul that automates all the steps needed to live migrate a container with the smallest \"freeze time\" possible. For that it orchestrates the work of three core CRIU functionalities -- memory pre- and lazy- c/r, general save-restore and disk-less images transfer.</p>\n<p>An essential part of the CRIU tool is the library called \"Compel\" which lets you inject so called parasite code into a running process. This library is the base of CRIU, but is independent from it and allows doing some marvellous tricks like re-directinng IO streams for processes, doing apps live-updates, manipulating the internal state of a running application in a way more powerful manner than gdb allows, etc.</p>\n",

It is the sole project with this mission and we estimate that our 334,000 catalogue entries cover some two-thirds of all sources in collections around the world. Our data are available publicly at <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu</a> and our audiences comprise primarily scholars and students, but with growing numbers of informal learners.</p>\n<p>At the heart of cdli is a group of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers, and cuneiform specialists who develop software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href=\"https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.\nDBpedia currently describes 38.3 million \"things\" of 685 different \"types\" in 125 languages, with over 3 billion \"facts\". It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications. For example, BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.\nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That is the kind of query we are talking about.\nWe are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</p>\n",

The generator is updated by employing a policy gradient and Monte Carlo (MC) search on the basis of the expected end reward received from the discriminator model. The reward is estimated by the likelihood that it would fool the discriminator model. We envisage that this approach will result in more fluent and adequate verbalizations. It is also noteworthy that this would be a novel approach to solve the problem statement which has never been previously explored in literature. Closest available research is that of (Yu et al., 2017), however they do not rely on graphical input representations for their model, and employ an RNN based encoding module within their generator network.</p>\n",

This operating system that we have created is called Debian.</p>\n<p>An operating system is the set of basic programs and utilities that make your computer run. At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.</p>\n<p>Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.</p>\n<p>However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.</p>\n<p>A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.</p>\n<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.</p>\n<p>It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.</p>\n",

Internet users have widely demonstrated Cloudflare's discriminatory practices against anonymous Tor users and web browsers on online forums and research papers. These practices limit or completely block webpages' functionality for \"certain\" users by implementing endless CAPTCHA loops. Therefore, the \"Cloudflare CAPTCHA Monitoring\" project aims to track how often Cloudflare fronted webpages return CAPTCHAs to Tor clients. The project achieves this by fetching webpages via both Tor and other mainstream web browsers and comparing the results. The tests are repeated periodically to find the patterns over time.

The current version of 4diac IDE does not support the validation of the models, which makes it difficult for users to get design-time feedback on inconsistencies regarding the models developed in 4diac. The Object Constraint Language (OCL) could be a solution to find issues in 4diac models since it provides capabilities for specifying generic constraints a model has to fulfill.

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://globalframenet.org\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet</a> initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h3>The Database</h3>\n<p>FN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h3>The Applications</h3>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal <a href=\"https://github.com/FrameNetBrasil/webtool\" target=\"_blank\">web annotation tool</a>, a domain-specific dictionary - the <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/world-cup-dictionary/\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary</a>; a system for recommending tourist attractions - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/m-knob/\" target=\"_blank\">m.knob</a>; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.</p>\n",

Throughout the GSoC 2020, I will modify existing parsers and create neural networks to project semantic frames and frame elements to unannotated sentences. I mainly work with projections on the manually aligned sentences and aligned sentences generated through transitivity. In addition to suggesting techniques for tackling m:n alignment, I also propose metrics for evaluating the projections in binary and graded manners as well as a phraseological method for analyzing projections for metaphorical phrases. If time permits, I would create sentence alignment models for aligning EN-JP, EN-FR, EN-UR, and EN-HI sentences.</p>\n",

So, while rendering distance fields in such applications, the renderer can simply check the pixel's value and discard ones that are greater than a specific range. This makes distance fields almost infinity scalable without losing quality, this means you can use a 128x128 resolution distance transform and it will provide better quality than a 4k resolution image and will also require much less space.

There areseveral different methods for reading kernel routing table information, updating kernel routingtables, and for looking up interfaces. One of them is Linux Netlink - asynchronouscommunication between kernel and user. FRRouting with its dataplane abstraction, uses aqueue of dataplane context objects for messages waiting to be sent. A separate thread loopsover this queue and sends the context objects to the appropriate dataplane. Every singlemessage is handled and sent separately, but there’s room for improvement. Certaindataplanes allow for sending multiple messages to them at once, so we could benefit from it.This would improve overall processing time.

The game engine is general purpose and powerful enough for any 2D game. \nGDevelop was used for hundreds of indie games on <strong>Android, iOS</strong>, desktop (<strong>Windows/macOS/Linux</strong>) or the <strong>web</strong> (HTML5 games).</p>\n<h3>Events: making game creation intuitive for all</h3>\n<p>What makes GDevelop unique and so easy to use are the <strong>events</strong>. Events are a powerful way to express the logic of your game, without having to learn a programming language. In an event, you specify one or more conditions that are applied on the game objects. If they are fulfilled, actions are launched.\nThese events are then translated to code when the game is exported or previewed.</p>\n<p>GDevelop takes visual programming to the next step, allowing to add <em>ready-made behaviors</em> to game objects and to <em>make new behaviors</em> using these intuitive, easy to learn events.</p>\n<h3>An extensible and robust game engine</h3>\n<p>GDevelop has out of the box support for <a href=\"https://gdevelop-app.com/features/\" target=\"_blank\">physics, shaders, particles, rich text, tweens, pathfinding, a platformer engine</a>... and is bundled with 80+ examples.</p>\n<p>Extensions can be developed to enhance the game engine - all built-in features are provided by extensions. Users and developers can make extensions using <strong>JavaScript</strong> or using the <strong>visual \nevents</strong>.</p>\n<p>The game engine and the editors are based on <strong>WebGL</strong> and <strong>JavaScript</strong> (Pixi.js, React.js for the editor interface) and <strong>WebAssembly</strong> (some parts are implemented in C++). It's easy to <a href=\"https://github.com/4ian/GDevelop/blob/master/newIDE/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">start developing on the editor or extensions</a> in a few minutes!</p>\n<h3>Documentation and wiki</h3>\n<p>GDevelop is fully documented, with <strong>help pages</strong> and <strong>tutorials</strong> on <a href=\"http://wiki.compilgames.net/doku.php/gdevelop5/start\" target=\"_blank\">the wiki</a> (including one written during Google Season of Docs!).</p>\n",

This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling.</p>\n<p>In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute intractable multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in computational economics as, by exploiting approximate volume computation of convex bodies, we use it to detect financial crises and evaluate portfolios performance in large stock markets with hundreds of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.</p>\n",

The package volesti is a C++ software with an R interface in CRAN which provides 4 geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex polytopes among other algorithms in the field of geometric statistics. A classical and difficult problem is to know when the Markov chain converges to the target distribution in order to stop sampling. Diagnostics are tools that can be used to check whether the quality of a sample generated with an MCMC algorithm is sufficient to provide an accurate approximation of the target distribution. The goals of this project are to provide: i) three diagnostic tools for a random walk to check convergence to the target distribution, ii) efficient implementations of all the known geometric random walks for uniform sampling from convex bodies, that are not implemented in volesti and iii) an improved implementation for Billiard walk which is already implemented in volesti. The diagnostic tools would allow us to compare the mixing time of various random walks, which is a classical and hard problem in high dimensional statistics.</p>\n",

Schema service is designed as a REST full web service and mainly it manages GA4GH JSON Sachems. Schema Repository is the persistence layer for Schema Service and JSON schemas can be stored within the schema repository for retrieval.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

While GNSS can provide us precise positions estimation, the GNSS signal can be easily affected by some error sources, for example, jamming signal in this project. \nIn this project, our main hypothesis is that jamming signals can be considered as outliers (either in time of frequency domain) to the received GNSS signal. To mitigate those outliers,  robust version of cross-ambiguity functions (CAFs) are introduced with Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimator under heavy tailed distribution and M-estimator. Thus we can reduce the affect of jamming signals in terms of outliers and make GNSS more robust.</p>\n",

It also provides faster debugging of pre-existing bugs even by new developers, as they can easily jump to class/method definitions without having prior knowledge of the directory structure of the project.

With a plethora of different sets of governing equations, neuronal models with complex biophysical properties, synapses with plasticity and parameters, a mechanism to derive generalized platform-independent model description becomes inevitable. Further, the model description mechanism helps in easy access and reproduction of the models, and thereby exasperating reference to the platform-specific source code shall be avoided. Currently, Brian uses <code>brian2tools.nmlexport</code> package to elegantly export Brian models to <code>NeuroML</code>. However, it is confined and cannot be extended easily to various other generalized model descriptors. Therefore, the project proposes an idea to create a generalized basic framework, which can coherently describe Brian models in a standard format and shall be easily extended to various other formats. The proposed idea would substantially enhance the interfacing functionality of Brian models with other standard model descriptors and thereby helps various users and research communities.</p>\n",

However, the fMRI data modeling performed by TVB suffers from the drawback of considering a standard model for the underlying Hemodynamic Response Function (HRF), throughout a brain and across various brain models. Several studies have indicated that HRF shows variability across both the subjects and across various brain regions of a particular subject. To account for the same, we aim at extending the rsHRF-toolbox  to interface between estimating region-specific resting-state HRF (rsHRF) from fMRI data, and modeling BOLD activity in TVB. The extended toolbox shall take fMRI data as input, estimate the region-specific rsHRF for regions (network nodes) defined by the connectome used in TVB, and mediate the fMRI data simulations through TVB's Bold monitor and BoldRegionROI monitor while accounting for the underlying HRF variability across the network. We also aim to build a GUI interface for the toolbox and consequently a docker implementation for the same as we expect end-users from various communities and backgrounds.</p>\n",

The obvious solution to increase the datasets’ size is to collect data from multiple sites,  but using data with multiple sources needs a very high level of care to make the data collected compatible. \nNeuroscience is very interdisciplinary and not all researchers involved in the process should have to collect their own data to do what they do best.

In the previous edition of GSOC the large scale network model for the macaque cortex, proposed by Mejias et. al, was successfully converted. A natural extension of this model was proposed in a paper by Joglekar et. al . Instead of using non-linear firing rate models, the cortical area was simulated as a spiking neuronal network. This was extremely useful to investigate the propagation of activity in the synchronous and asynchronous regime of the network. My goal in this project is to convert this model to PyNN allowing the simulation in several simulators.  As a secondary goal in this project, I would like to convert the model proposed by Demirtas et. al.   that is a large-scale circuit model of human cortex incorporating regional heterogeneity in microcircuit properties inferred from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for parametrization across the cortical hierarchy and fitting models to resting-state functional connectivity.</p>\n",

I would propose to use model parameter optimization based on bifurcation analysis. This would use computational tools based on the theory of nonlinear dynamical systems to generate maps of parameter space that indicate the location of bifurcations at which one type of model behavior transitions into another type. These models may use many unknown parameters and specific weights. We can construct a network by fixing the known parameters and train it on input and output to determine the unknown parameters. I believe a bifurcation analysis of this model would provide solutions for sets of states for a given set of parameters. The way we adjust parameters and weights we may analyze the computations of a neural system in how it generates ideas from the organization of a network. I hope creating an algorithm of bifurcation analysis would provide insight into features of neuronal dynamics like multistability, oscillations, and symmetry.</p>\n",

These features and extensibility have made Inkscape the wonderful software it is today.\nBut, these features come with a cost, i.e. difficulty accessing these features. Currently, operations have to be searched through highly nested and huge drop-downs. Also, you have to remember where the option was. Keyboard shortcuts don't solve the problem due to their learning curve, system shortcuts, and the limit on the number of keys that can humanly be pressed.\nCommand Palette(CP) is an interactive search bar that can search any operation (extensions, edits, filters, etc.) that Inkscape provides. CP is also a tool for the <strong>power users</strong> It speeds up the access times by using commands that help users to bypass the slow GUI and use mostly their speedy keyboards.\nAnother problem is repetition. The ordered nature of most drawings calls for repetition. As we know Inkscape is a tool for creative people and nothing kills creativity faster than repetition. \nMacros are a way to record your actions and repeat them. Command Stack provides a GUI way to make macros.</p>\n",

Intrusion Detection using Elytron is aimed at doing the same i.e. to extend Elytron’s functionality. \nIntrusion Detection is the art of sensing when a system or network is being used inappropriately or without authorization. Without intrusion detection, an attacker can attempt attacks many times until an attack is finally successful.

Then studying and comparing the existing Quarkus Maven plugin source code and Quarkus Gradle plugin source code we realize where Quarkus lags behind in the case of Gradle. The points where Quarkus lags can be enhanced by comparing and replicating all the integration tests of Maven plugin for Gradle plugin to increase the overall test coverage for Gradle.</p>\n",

The fingerprint engine of Jenkins can track usages of artifacts, credentials, files, etc within the system. It does this by maintaining a local XML-based database. This leads to dependence on the physical disk of the Jenkins master. Hence, the core idea of this project is to extend Jenkins core to support storing of fingerprints in an external storage, which would be managed by storage system specific plugins. This would involve designing and creating the external fingerprint storage API. The API would also allow multiple Jenkins instances to store their fingerprints inside a single external storage instance, enabling traceability of artifacts across the CI/CD flow. The project also involves creating two plugins, as reference implementations. These plugins would allow users to store fingerprints inside their Redis and PostgreSQL instances.</p>\n",

They come in two forms: bitmap textures, which are images contained in e.g. PNG or OpenEXR files, or procedural textures, which are generated on the fly using their mathematical representation.</p>\n<p>KDE’s Krita painting suite supports using patterns and textures through two types of layers, File or Fill Layers. However, neither of them let artists create dynamically generated content: File Layers are inherently static, and Fill Layers support only color fills (like Paint Layers) or basic pattern rendering.</p>\n<p>The goal of this project is to let artists create dynamic content through a new, scriptable Fill Layer. To this effect, I propose to integrate Disney Animation’s SeExpr expression language into Krita.</p>\n",

An open-source participatory project based on the users operating a ground station accessible on the web for all of the network users. A basic ground station up can be set-up using commercial off-the-shelf components that are commonly available with a static omnidirectional antenna, to more complex stations with multiple movable antennas. To facilitate the later we provide open hardware for those that want to build their own. As of the time of writing, 210+ stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and 100+ are tested globally by University cubesat teams, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.</p>\n<p>Libre Space, together with the University of Patras, are the makers of UPSat, the 1st free software, open-hardware cubesat. Currently, we are developing an open-hardware satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network. In parallel, we are exploring the smaller PocketQube form factor in our Qubik mission of two PocketQube satellites and a PockeQube deployer system PicoBus.</p>\n<p>Libre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities. SDR Maker Space working on several open-source Software Defined Radio sub-activities to facilitate satellite communications and OpenSatCOM working on sustainable development practices for satellite communications projects.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>LibreOffice is a modern Free &amp; Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

This can take two forms.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A simulation model for a memory controller that is tunable.</li>\n<li>A synthesizable module to be placed between the soft core implementation and an existing non-tunable DRAM controller.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Novelty and benefits to the community</h3>\n<p>So far, papers have been reluctant to provide accurate processor core performance figures extrapolated from FPGA implementation because DRAM controllers have an unrealistically high clock speed clock speed relatively to a soft core, compared to an ASIC core implementation. Providing the community with open source tunable memory controller models dedicated to the benchmarking of soft cores will greatly help producing more accurate and interpretable core  and accelerator performance figures without requiring an ASIC tape-out in the first place, which is often not even an option.</p>\n",

The project would touch upon other parts of the Matrix ecosystem for Go. Specifically the gomatrix library would need to be enhanced to support encryption-specific events (such as for the uploading and claiming of keys, handling of encrypted room events) and would potentially contain the bulk of the interactions with libolm, making it easier for future projects in Go to use the same functionality. Finally proper bindings for libolm need to be developed - some such projects exist but lack necessary operations for full E2E communications. The final result of this project would be go-neb working fully in encrypted rooms, as transparently as possible to its services.</p>\n",

MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/\" target=\"_blank\">new computational tools</a>.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by  MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protein databank</a> (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis is a project written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, softmatter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited almost a thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Currently, extensions are limited to just non-visible components. Due to this, extensions can't be dragged into the screen designer. To work around this, extension developers have to get a reference to a visible component as parent under which they create UI views. This, however, defeats the idea of App Inventor, which allows the users to create their UI of their apps using the concept of WYSIWYG.\nMy proposal to solve this problem is to have a generic <code>MockVisibleComponentExtension</code> which can be dragged into the designer. The extension will be just a visible component as opposed to non-visible component. This allows the extension to be placed under a <code>ComponentContainer</code> under which the extension can create its views. This allows the users to view a clear hierarchy of their app's UI when using \"visible\" extension. Then, there will also be a need for <code>MockComponentContainerExtension</code> into which any visible component/extension can be placed.</p>\n",

Instead of having to juggle beatmatching, effects, cues and sliders all at once, a DJ should be able to rely on his tools so he can focus on what really matters. For some, beatmatching and syncing two tracks is an art in itself - for others, including me, it is something happily delegated to the software - that is why there is a sync function.</p>\n<p>But sometimes, more sophisticated automation can be helpful - maybe you want to skip a breakdown, shuffle around verses, loop an intro a specific way or deliberately repeat certain parts.

Documentation has been moved to in-tree which offers great advantages such as that it can be updated along with the source.

In the case of Musescore, the code was written manually for QT, with all the drawing and file handling code written manually. So the classes in libmscore follow this tree-like model somewhat informally, but not explicitly. I will be refactoring the code, such that the classes in libmscore follow this model exactly by adding a \"children\" list to the ScoreElement class. Many operations can then be written as tree traversals. This would prevent a lot of duplication in code, and simplify the code in a lot of places.</p>\n",

Perhaps more importantly, type annotations act as machine-checked documentation and make your code easier to understand and maintain. Mypy can scale to multi-million line codebases, while providing quick incremental checking through the mypy daemon.</p>\n<p>Mypy lets you freely mix type checked and unannotated code, making it possible to gradually migrate existing codebases to static type checking.</p>\n<h4>What is mypyc?</h4>\n<p>Mypyc is a compiler from a type annotated Python dialect to CPython C extension modules that uses mypy as the front end. It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient.</p>\n<p>It's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs. Modules compiled with mypyc can freely interact with interpreted modules. Mypyc lets you compile a few performance-sensitive modules and keep the rest of your program interpreted.</p>\n",

In this project, we would like to continue the work to develop a C/C++ based optimization plugins that can be used directly by LibRoadrunner with the help of RRPlugins. RRPlugins is a software that uses Libroadrunner as a dependency to load plugins and perform optimization tasks. Now if we build roadrunner we need to build plugins again since plugins are designed in such a way that they use LibRoadRunner and RRPlugins both as a dependency.

It stores the data in a JSON file using SyncedAttrDict and JSONDict classes.\nCurrently, Signac uses SyncedAttrDict to store the statepoints and JSONDict to store the documents.

In some areas this is a vast oversimplification of the physical reality; light exists on a continuous spectrum of wavelengths. Spectral rendering achieves better accuracy by taking that into account. The major drawback is that it cannot use widely available color data for surfaces such as photographs. The process of gathering usable spectral data is significantly more time- and resource-intensive.</p>\n<p>Spectral upsampling is the process of extrapolating spectral information from RGB color data. This is possible because, in practice, spectral reflectivities, which describe how a surface interacts with incident light on a wavelength-by-wavelength basis, tend to fit relatively simple patterns. The goal would be to add support for several newly published algorithms to Colour, a color science library for Python. With the rising popularity of spectral rendering, the library would greatly benefit from the work.</p>\n",

However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader. NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards. NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.</p>\n<p>Major highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel </li>\n<li>A built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices </li>\n<li>Reporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors </li>\n<li>Support for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard </li>\n<li>Ability to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation </li>\n<li>Easy to use talking installer </li>\n<li>Support for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants </li>\n<li>Ability to run at Windows logon and other secure screens</li>\n</ul>\n",

In more recent times, the focus has shifted on pangenomes, that encode genomic variation across multiple individuals of a certain species.\nPangenome graphs (also called Variation Graphs) are used to store and represent pangenomes. Multiple open-source tools have been developed for building and analyzing Variation Graphs and VG (<a href=\"https://github.com/vgteam/vg\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/vgteam/vg</a>) is the most popular one. VG provides a framework to work with Variation Graphs, and it is currently capable of handling moderately-sized graphs. However, it has issues scaling up for large datasets.\nI want to improve its performances by building a highly parallel graph explorer that makes use of GPU architecture in Rust. GPUs are well known for their ability to do millions of operations at the same time, however achieving this requires code to be written in a speciﬁc, parallel-oriented way. I think that, with help from the mentors, this can surely happen, and VG will be able to explore Variation Graphs much faster.</p>\n",

Currently, pysradb is transitioning to phase out its dependency on an SRAmetadb.Sqlite file from the SRAdb project. While this file provides a fast, offline method of retrieving metadata found in SRA, it is very large; downloading the file represents a significant hurdle for users.</p>\n<p>This project seeks to implement a search module for pysradb. This search module should be able to take in the user’s search query, parse it accordingly, query the SRA database and then retrieve and display the search results to the user. As the main consideration of this search module is user-friendliness, I propose several additional features to make pysradb more effective in achieving user's needs. These features include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Accepting additional input parameters to finetune search results.</li>\n<li>Processing and organisation of search results into more user-friendly formats.</li>\n<li>Automatic generation of statistics and graphs, which serves to provide summary information about a search query for the user.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Usually, electron density assigned in the atoms that constitute the molecule is a key element in this process. This partitioning of the electrons itself do not suggest any observable properties of a molecule. However, many observable features of a molecule are derived directly from the electron densities, hence motivating chemists to relentlessly improve this <em>noumena</em> step by step.\nCurrently, cclib can calculate some common atomic charge potential methods, including C-squared Population Analysis, Mulliken Population Analysis, and Lowdin Population Analysis. Because Mulliken Population Analysis and Lowdin Population Analysis are similar in its theory (Lowdin uses a different basis set to reduce the basis set dependence observed in Mulliken Analysis), it would be advantageous to have other modern calculation methods implemented in cclib. Some examples of the methods that can be implemented include DDEC6, Hirshfeld method, Bader analysis, ISA (through a bridge to Horton) and so on.</p>\n",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.</p>\n<p><strong>The Lab</strong></p>\n<p>The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://lab.open-roberta.org/</a> is online and has had more than 500 000 visits in 2019 across more than 120 countries.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 12 different robot plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EV3 LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>NXT LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>BBC micro:bit</li>\n<li>Calliope mini</li>\n<li>Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based</li>\n<li>NAO, a humanoid robot</li>\n<li>BOB3</li>\n<li>Nepo4Arduino</li>\n<li>mBot</li>\n<li>SenseBox</li>\n<li>WeDo LEGO</li>\n<li>Edison</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Outlook</strong></p>\n<p>While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.</p>\n",

Accurate numerical computation of these geodesics near Black Holes is paramount to advance our knowledge of the relativistic physics, surrounding these extreme gravitational objects, as the nearest stellar mass black hole is ~3000 ly away, making astronomical observations nearly impractical. Without proper astronomical reference to compare against, it is impossible to obtain data on the line profile of these celestial bodies, due to the appreciable general relativistic corrections required. In this project, we will consider two spacetime geometries, the Schwarzschild and Kerr Metrics, and implement python modules, that (1) help in solving geodesic equations, given initial conditions; (2) raytracing photons (null geodesics); and (3) help in performing some advanced simulations and visualizations, like simulating accretion flow, gravitational lensing and calculations, related to redshifted photons due to the spacetime curvature, near these bodies. We will survey the existing state-of-the-art literature and pick a performant implementation for the two geometries.</p>\n",

However, compared with the state-of-the-art scene text recognition algorithms, the text and digit recognition samples in OpenCV are out of date. These samples are based on traditional classifiers, which is difficult to handle the complex scenarios in the real world. Hence, I propose to improve the text recognition samples with the representative algorithms of scene text recognition from our research group. Specifically, CRNN is a good choice for its high accuracy and efficiency. Because there are some unsupported network layers and operations in OpenCV, I will modify the related parts of the original network. Moreover, it is necessary to accelerate the text recognizor with the CUDA support in OpenCV DNN Module. In conclusion, I propose to implement a fast text recognition sample in OpenCV, and build a complete text spotting pipeline for scene text detection and recognition.</p>\n",

First of all, mapping Vulkan buffer to WebGPU buffer to access the storage of WebGPU.Secondly, mapping Vulkan API calls for pipeline and command buffer to WebGPU API. Thirdly I’ll reuse Vulkan's shaders. It’s feasible to reuse Vulkan’s shader directly in Chrome.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide that raises all ships.</p>\n<p>Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The transformations are reproducible: they can be replayed on datasets in the same format, with updated data. The focus is on usability through a web UI, reducing the need to learn a programming or query language.</p>\n<h4> Stack</h4>\n<p>OpenRefine is built in Java (server-side) and uses a web UI (jQuery). It is easy to work on isolated parts of the code without being familiar with the entire architecture. We try to maintain good quality standards, by testing all our changes, but remain flexible and un-opiniated.</p>\n",

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/homepage/elenco-siti-tematici/wifimetropolitano/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.</p>\n<p>From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/it/progetti/openwisp\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org\" target=\"_blank\">network management system</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.</p>\n",

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.</p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven lesson creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.</p>\n<p>Since a Kickstarter in mid-2017, <a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\">key members of our community</a> have built a <a href=\"http://live.orcasound.net\" target=\"_blank\">web app</a> that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, now in beta-testing, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite\" target=\"_blank\">web-app repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. While users enjoy the live “concert” they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas’ ability to communicate &amp; echolocate scarce salmon.</p>\n<p>Orcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode\" target=\"_blank\">orcanode</a> holds Python code and shell scripts that generate the live audio stream in lossy HLS or DASH format to optimize audio playback within modern browsers and lossless FLAC format for scientific analysis. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcadata\" target=\"_blank\">orcadata</a> houses  multiple team efforts to develop machine learning algorithms and data processing tools for bioacoustics and underwater noise pollution.  </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcabooth\" target=\"_blank\">orcabooth</a> shares Orcasound recordings with educational/outreach organizations. </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcamap\" target=\"_blank\">orcamap</a> visualizes acoustic detection and classification data spatially.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Such a drawing of a planar graph is called a plane drawing. Every planar graph also admits a straight-line drawing, which is a plane drawing where each edge is represented by a line segment. When a graph has K5 or K3,3 as subgraph then the graph is not planar.  This algorithm is only applicable for <strong>undirected</strong> graphs. It has a linear time complexity of <strong>O(|V|)</strong>.</p>\n<p><strong>Boost::make_connected</strong> Adds the minimum number of edges needed to make the input graph connected. The algorithm first identifies all of the connected components in the graph, then adds edges to connect those components together in a path. For example, if a graph contains three connected components A, B, and C, make_connected will add two edges. The two edges added might consist of one connecting a vertex in A with a vertex in B and one connecting a vertex in B with a vertex in C.  This algorithm is only applicable for <strong>undirected</strong> graphs.

AR Area module allows users to export measured \"AR measurements\" into text format and which can be used for further analysis.

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

Many monitor tools are available as part of the core PCP release, while other (typically graphical) monitoring tools are available separately in the pcp-gui or grafana-pcp packages.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The PCP architecture is distributed in the sense that any PCP tool may be executing remotely. On the host (or hosts) being monitored, each domain of performance metrics, whether the kernel, a service layer, a database management system, a web server, an application, etc. requires a Performance Metrics Domain Agent (PMDA) which is responsible for collecting performance measurements from that domain. All PMDAs are controlled by the Performance Metrics Collector Daemon (PMCD) on the same host.</p>\n<p>Client applications (the monitoring tools) connect to PMCD, which acts as a router for requests, by forwarding requests to the appropriate PMDA and returning the responses to the clients.

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.</p>\n",

Currently in PCL, this has been done by providing separate classes/functions having independent APIs.</p>\n<p>With the integration of execution policies and executors (part of C++23 hopefully) libraries like PCL will be able to provide a unified API to switch between different implementations. To ensure there is no sudden breakage in the existing API, a transition phase is needed to slowly phase out the old API in favour of a unified API.</p>\n<h3>Implementation</h3>\n<p>This project aims to transition the existing API to forward-compatible unified API. \nThe basic details are:\nUsing tag dispatching to enable function overloading, allowing user to select  between different available implementations.\nLack of tags allows PCL to choose best possible implementations, this allows to maintain backward compatibility with current API.\nMissing implementation for a tag raises compile-time errors\nProviding SIMD/OpenMP/CUDA implementations of existing algorithms using the proposed unified API.</p>\n",

Currently the unumpy library is incomplete as a mirror image of the core NumPy API so I intend to work on expanding its current coverage by adding around 150 function stubs and a JAX backend.</p>\n",

So, I'll add a feature to generate single page HTML Reports which will be human-readable and will provide the user with much additional information like Total Scanned Files, Total Products with known vulnerability and severity analysis for each product. The report will also have a feature to search for data easily and due to the single page nature, it can be shared easily.

The problem here is that most people do not want to sign in to Gitlab to send an issue and want something faster within the same interface of EOS. The aim of this project is to design a scalable backend infrastructure that delivers a web interface allowing users to request new icons in an easy and intuitive way. Users can attach files with the request to explain what they want. The admins or EOS maintainers can then resolve, close and revise these requests. Even users can comment and vote for the existing requests. This can also serve as an efficient feedback and response mechanism which is critical for any organization to improve and make progress. Thus, it potentially becomes another reusable open source project for EOS.</p>\n",

However, there are some key features which are currently missing from mscolab. I propose to work on the following features and improvements to mscolab:</p>\n<h3>Local Flight Path Editing:</h3>\n<p>There are many instances where a user might want to test out his/her own changes to the flight path locally without changing the path on the server. Another scenario is that the user has a slow network connection at the flight campaign location which is a common problem. Both these situations require a method for the users to be able to make changes to the flight path locally and then be able to compare and merge it with the flight path on the server later.</p>\n<h3>Chat Service Improvements:</h3>\n<p>Improve the communication between users by adding features like - markdown support, ability to send images, searching through messages, ability to delete messages and replying to a specific message.</p>\n<h3>Admin Dashboard:</h3>\n<p>Develop an admin dashboard window to allow mscolab project admins to manage users efficiently, giving them options to add/modify/delete user permissions in bulk.</p>\n",

This operating mode in QEMU is called the user mode and it is much simpler than the more commonly known system mode in which the full computer system is emulated. The user mode is useful for fast cross execution and debugging and is usually executed on Linux based systems. It achieves this cross execution by having its' own implementations of system functions from the Linux kernel interface. Although many system functions are supported in QEMU, the kernel is constantly extended by addition of new system calls. QEMU user mode can't consistently follow this kernel extension and thus many kernel functions are left unimplemented. The goal of this project is to significantly extend this QEMUs implementation of system functions so that many user programs that depend on these system calls can be safely cross executed. This projects' contribution also extends to the Linux Test Project by developing unit tests for system functions implemented within QEMU.</p>\n",

On the one hand, the usefulness of the hyperSpec package for spectroscopic research is clear\nand immediately useful to R programmers and practitioners of bioinformatics, chemoinformatics, and medical\nstatistics. On the other hand, the infrastructure afforded by hyperSpec has led to various dependencies on other\nR packages, large amounts of test data, and more than a hundred .R files. Accordingly, the current state of the\npackage has become difficult to maintain and vulnerable to fixes related to dependencies on deprecated\npackages. Thus, the project Fortification of the hyperSpec R Package aims to tackle these issues through distilling, shielding, and bridging the hyperSpec ecosystem.</p>\n",

Planning biodiversity inventories involves a series of complications that derive not only from economic capacities but also from the difficulty of designing a survey system that warranties registering most species in a region. Planning adequate survey systems is challenging as not only geographical factors influence species distributions. Species distributions depend on complicated relationships between accessible areas, environmental conditions, and biotic interactions. As a survey aims to register species in a region, biotic interaction could be overlooked. However, the relationship between environmental conditions and the geographic configuration is of crucial importance when trying to identify key sites for biodiversity sampling.

However, none, to our knowledge, have addressed the issue of robustness toward additive outliers, rather than innovations outliers. Muler and Yohai (2008) proposed two approaches to robust GARCH(p,q) model fitting to avoid bias in the parameter estimates and the preceding kind of over-estimation of volatility following isolated large outlier returns. In the first approach, parameters are obtained by maximum likelihood function using a modified likelihood function based on a bounded loss function. The second approach improves on the first by using a filter that limits the effect of an additive outlier on subsequent predictors of conditional variance. Our proposal is to implement the two approaches by exposing interfaces to a C++ library that can be called from any higher level language for estimating the likelihood functon. We will first develop an R implementation of the robust GARCH(p, q) fitting method, with application examples, and evaluate the performance of the code using as bench- marks selected simulation results from Muler and Yohai.</p>\n",

We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2020, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>\n",

This time we are aiming for generating these scores as a heatmap(such as the heat maps shown in <a href=\"https://ljmanso.com/sngnn\" target=\"_blank\">https://ljmanso.com/sngnn</a>) which can produce all the scores at once, this will be more efficient and faster than the previous work done. To solve this issue of generating all the scores at once we will try to generate a bitmap image using CNNs. As we are dealing with graphs of scenarios here we will be using GNNs.</p>\n",

To be accepted in these types of scenarios, it is important that the robot navigate respecting social norms, for example, avoiding getting too close to humans, avoiding interrupting a conversation or asking permission to pass through a blocked path. This project aims to describe the dialogue manager, besides the corpus that allows establishing dialogues between the robot and the humans in real situations to improve the behavior of the robot navigation system, making it more socially accepted. The dialogue manager will be a RoboComp agent, which reads information from the robot’s world representation (a graph) and adapts the conversation to the current situation (e.g, according to the age of people, genre, etc).</p>\n",

But when it comes to rapidly prototyping of applications and ease of use of APIs, it lags behind other languages like python which is one of the most widely used languages just because of this reason and also due to the plethora of libraries that it provides. So, binding the C++ APIs and exposing them to the python interface can be helpful in extending the use of innermodel lib to beginner developers with minimal knowledge of programming. By exposing C++ APIs to python we are achieving two things at the same time: getting the performance from C++ and ease of use through python, which can also increase contributions from the dev community and later help in the development of innermodel lib or robocomp in general.</p>\n",

RTEMS includes optional functional features such as TCP/IP and file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations.</p>\n<p>The RTEMS Project is the collection of individuals, companies, universities, and research institutions that collectively maintain and enhance the RTEMS software base. As a community, we are proud to be popular in the space application software and experimental physics communities. RTEMS has been to Venus, circles Mars, is aboard Curiosity, is in the asteroid belt, is on its way to Jupiter, and soon will circle the sun. It is in use in many high energy physics research labs around the world. There are many RTEMS users who do not belong to the space or physics communities, but our small part in contributing to basic scientific knowledge makes us proud.</p>\n",

In the current RTEMS version, a lower-priority ready task must wait if all the processors included in its affinity mask are executing higher-priority tasks. Since a lower-priority task can never “dislodge” a higher-priority task that could also execute elsewhere, this may needlessly prevent some tasks from being scheduled, even if some processors idle as a result[1].</p>\n<p>This project aims to add the Strong Arbitrary Processor Affinity (Strong APA) scheduler to RTEMS. Strong APA scheduler would allow higher-priority tasks to be ”dislodged” or moved among processors in order to make space for lower priority tasks that are limited by affinity constraints [1]. Consequently, this would allow RTEMS to achieve improved schedulability (i.e., lower response-time bounds).</p>\n<p>References : [1] Cerqueira, Felipe &amp; Gujarati, Arpan &amp; Brandenburg, Bjorn.

Computing the number of linear extensions, in general, takes O(n!) time, given a poset of n elements. However, many efficient algorithms are known for certain large classes of posets. SageMath offers a single function to calculate the linear extensions of a poset. For even small posets, this quickly becomes impossible to use. The goal of this project would be to implement efficient methods of computing linear extensions of several important classes of posets, and introduce uniform sampling of linear extensions. This includes tree posets, d-complete posets, skew diagrams, mobile posets, and more.</p>\n",

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 35 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.<br>\nThis library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the \nBoost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and \nvery portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including \nLinux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as \naccelerators such as the Xeon Phi.</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications \nwhich makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and \ndistributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms.

We utilize a modern parallelization library, HPX, to develop the parallel solver. The goal of the proposed solution is to achieve full distribution of workload starting from mesh partition to computation of fields at mesh nodes. The following goal is achieved step by step, starting from a simple sequential implementation of 1D nonlocal diffusion. The 1D nonlocal diffusion equation is made multi-threaded to enable concurrent processing within a single node and then is extended to a 2D nonlocal diffusion equation. The 2D nonlocal diffusion equation is then made completely distributed to exploit data level parallelism.</p>\n",

Older SVG views have been converted to HTML5 Canvas to make a responsive user interface with enhanced interactivity. A new chart containing a histogram of primitive duration has been created to filter out intervals of a specific duration. This supplements the user experience in discovery of intervals having too long or too short duration. Interpretability of the Gantt chart has been augmented by the addition of traceback lines (from a child interval to its parent) and color highlighting which eventually helps to track down dependent and relevant intervals. The hardware performance counter values have been made more explicit by representing aggregated (minimum, maximum, average) values. The Traveler interface is now equipped with more options for explorative performance analysis, better feature detection, easier artifact isolation, and faster debugging.</p>\n",

But it would be useful to have an option for strace to translate these ids to strace's own pid namespace. For example when tracing a process inside a Docker container, the translated PIDs allows us, to access these the processes from the host environment (eg. inspecting processes created by the clone syscall).\nThe goal of the project is to add a flag to strace, which enables this translation.</p>\n",

I will be taking on the first of these two hurdles.</p>\n",

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.</p>\n<p><strong>Simplify complex log data</strong></p>\n<p>Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.</p>\n<p><strong>Databases destinations</strong></p>\n<p>If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.</p>\n<p><strong>Message queue support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<p><strong>HTTP/REST support</strong></p>\n<p>syslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively</p>\n<p><strong>Support language bindings</strong></p>\n<p>Want to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.</p>\n",

From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).</p>\n",

However, some other crucial parts of the Mesh R-CNN approach need to be implemented als modules into TensorFlow Graphics.

Each of them has some libraries such as TensorFlow Graphics or Kaolin, which help users to use 3D models in neural networks easily. Unfortunately, none of the three works mentioned above are implemented in TensorFlow Graphics, whereas Kaolin provides their code. This is not a good situation for TensorFlow users who want to try using \"implicit 3D representations\" in their experiments or projects.\nIn this proposal, I propose a project to implement these three works in Tensorflow Graphics.

We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats.

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

We need to build the libraries that will unify this ecosystem and let the developers focus on what matters: building quality VMI apps. This is where libmicrovmi comes into play. It aims to solve this problem, by providing a core, foundation library, written in Rust, to be cross-platform, hypervisor-agnostic and emulator-agnostic, on top of which higher-level libraries and apps can rebase. Rust makes a lot of sense for VMI for 2 main reasons: Rust is safe: considering that we are processing untrusted input from virtual machines, we cannot allow any crash or exploitation in the introspection agent. I will be writing drivers for kvm and xen for libmicrovmi this summer.</p>\n",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2020 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Humboldt University - Germany, and Charles University - Czech Republic.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

We have added another implementation which is more generic and supports symbolic execution for all types of neural network architectures. We evaluated our implementation using a variety of architectures, namely MNIST0, MNIST1, MNIST2, and CIFAR. Evaluation results verified the correctness of the implementation. We believe that this GSoC implementation will make it easier for researchers to analyze a wide variety of neural networks. This will enable them to improve the neural network performance as well as help in identifying the vulnerabilities in already existing neural network architectures.</p>\n",

Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) have greatly increased productivity of probabilistic modelers, allowing practitioners to focus on modeling, as opposed to the implementing algorithms for probabilistic (e.g. Bayesian) inference. Turing is a PPL developed entirely in Julia and is both expressive and fast due partly to Julia’s just-in-time (JIT) compiler being implemented in LLVM.  Consequently, Turing has a more manageable code base and has the potential to be more extensible when compared to more established PPLs like STAN. One thing that may lead to the adoption of Turing is more benchmarks and feature comparisons of Turing to other mainstream PPLs. The aim of this project is to provide a more systematic approach to comparing execution times and features among several PPLs, including STAN, Pyro, nimble, and Tensorflow probability for a variety of Bayesian nonparametric (BNP) models, which are a class of models that provide a much modeling flexibility and often allow model complexity to increase with data size.</p>\n",

A patch stack is a set of changes that modifies a body of code. Open source development is driven by applying patch stacks to an existing codebase. PaStA helps to analyse them and groups patches based on their similarity. A number of open source projects ( eg. the Linux kernel ) leverage mailing lists to support their development. All communication happens on these lists and contributors send patches to the lists for the maintainers to review. Given a mailbox of such a project PaStA can also map upstream commit references to corresponding patches in the mailbox. One of the major goals for PaStA has been to integrate with Patchwork. Patchwork is a web based patch tracking system. It helps both contributors track the state of their patches and maintainers efficiently review patches. As a first step PaStA can be used to automate the process of adding related patches to a patch on Patchwork. The primary goal of this project is to complete PaStA’s integration with Patchwork.</p>\n",

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>\n<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</li>\n<li>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools. The Clang Static Analyzer is a clang-based tool that automatically finds bugs in your code.</li>\n<li>The LLDB project builds on libraries provided by LLVM and Clang to provide a great native debugger on top of Clang and LLVM libraries.</li>\n<li>The libc++ and libc++ ABI projects provide a standard conformant and high-performance implementation of the C++ Standard Library.</li>\n<li>The MLIR subproject aims to address software fragmentation, compilation for heterogeneous hardware, significantly reduce the cost of building domain specific compilers, and aid in connecting existing compilers.</li>\n<li>The lld project aims to be the built-in linker for clang/llvm. Currently, clang must invoke the system linker to produce executables.</li>\n<li>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks.</li>\n</ul>\n",

More importantly, YAML keeps our tests code base maintainable. However, yaml2obj currently doesn’t support generating DWARF sections very well (we have to hardcode the Content field of DWARF sections and it is not intuitive).

One of the main problems that needs to be solved is the long time (latency) that it takes to move data from the computer’s main memory to the device’s memory. Therefore, using the LLVM compiler infrastructure, the proposed solution consists of adding a new functionality to the current OpenMP interprocedural optimization pass, OpenMPOpt, such that the OpenMP runtime calls that involve host to device memory transfers are split into “issue” and “wait” functions. The “issue” function will contain the code necessary to transfer the data from the host to the device in an asynchronous manner, returning a handle in which the “wait” function will wait for completion. The “issue” and “wait” functions will be moved upwards and downwards respectively, until it is illegal to do so. Doing this, the instructions between the “issue” and the “wait” can be executed, while separately doing the data transfer to the device, hence, reducing the time the process is blocked waiting for the transfer to finish.</p>\n",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.30 in September 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 9000 members as of January 2020, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 250 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers</p>\n<h4>Our Games</h4>\n<p><em>Terasology</em> is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p><em>Destination Sol</em> is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h4>Architecture</h4>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n<h4>Codeuino</h4>\n<p>For GSOC 2020 we're supporting <a href=\"http://codeuino.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://codeuino.org</a> to let them offer project ideas through us.</p>\n",

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Focused</strong> around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.</p>\n<p><strong>Built in JavaScript</strong> webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Used at Scale</strong> webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Owned</strong> webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling</p>\n",

Additionally, I aim to produce guidance material to describe the existing abstractions both in the cursor operations and CRC computing in the VKMS and in the construction of tests that also include knowledge of Cairo.

Smack currently establishes connection between Server and Client using TCP and BOSH. BOSH suffers from high transport overhead as compared to TCP. Also various issues with long polling are suggested to have an impact upon BOSH based systems [RFC 6202 Section 2.2]. WebSocket provides an alternative to the limitation of inefficient communication between the server and the client by providing bi-directional, full-duplex, real-time client/server communications. The protocol consists of an opening handshake followed by basic message framing, layered over TCP [RFC 6455]. Adding WebSocket support to Smack will allow it to establish a continuous Client-Server connection with less overhead.</p>\n",

Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">much more</a> -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its <a href=\"http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html\" target=\"_blank\">extensive developer documentation</a> (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",
