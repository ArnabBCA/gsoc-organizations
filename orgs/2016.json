In the Google Summer of Code program, we shall try to achieve Web-based access for few of these tools. This module will be named ‘terrainTools’ and will be a standalone project.</p>\n",

The motivation of this project is to build a Standalone Track Analysis page in JavaScript(AngularJS) that could also serve as the starting point for the next generation website of the EnviroCar project. The current website implementation is in PHP and the intention is to implement it with AngularJS to allow for more flexibility while analyzing single track performance and also additional features like comparative track analysis. The above goal will be pursued with the help of LeafletJS, HighCharts, OpenCPU or ShinyApps. I have also proposed to add a framework to allow for incorporating a Rating's page that allows the user to compare his/her performance with average expected performance from a similar vehicle.</p>\n",

The majority of the rest of the calls to java.lang.reflect are from the comparators. The number of garbage collections was also significantly reduced. Similarly, by adding handwritten serializer to the POJO word count example could reduce the runtime from 9.5s to 8s on a 100mb input file.

Our goal is to host relevant projects in the Erlang community, making it easy for those projects to participate in the Google Summer of Code and for interested students to pick their best choice. The Erlang VM was originally designed by Ericsson to support distributed, fault-tolerant, soft-real-time, non-stop applications.</p>\n<p>Many companies around the world like Amazon, Heroku and Activision use the Erlang VM in their stack and open source projects like ejabberd, Riak, Phoenix, CouchDB, Zotonic and many more are built on top of it. Our currently hosted projects include the Elixir programming language, Disco, a distributed computing framework originated from Nokia, ejabberd, a robust XMPP server used largely around the world and others. This gives students a wide range of choices, that goes from working on distributed systems, to maintaining robust servers and language design.</p>\n",

Pure operation-based (aka op-based) CRDTs are variants of CRDTs that are generic and more efficient as they allow for compact solutions in both the sent messages and the state size. On the other hand, Lasp is a new programming model designed to simplify large scale, fault-tolerant, distributed programming using state-based CRDTs. It would be very interesting to implement the operation-based approach in Lasp and compare it with the currently implemented state-based approach.</p>\n",

For example, it could be interesting to calculate the abundance (by area) of regions like angiogenesis, necrosis, and infiltrating lymphocytes to infer patient-level characteristics.\n    A tissue slide can easily reach around 20GB in-memory, which turns intractable many approaches of feeding those slides entirely to a classifier. One recent method for addressing this problem is sampling regions based on low-resolution features (i.e. texture, boundaries) for extracting information about the tissue. Moreover, this method can also help with speeding up the processing, since after cropping the proposed regions, the problem would be turned into a tractable learning problem.</p>\n",

So for the purpose of solid modeling, it is commonly impractical to represent these thin solids exactly as bounded volume, thus an available approach is to assign an implicit thickness to each face and then we can consider the thickness as a face property. Simply speaking, when shooting a ray towards the B-rep model, we can get ‘in’ and ‘out’ hit point from a face while the ‘out’ hit point is a small offset from the ‘in’ one with given thickness value along the ray direction.</p>\n",

Defects in meshes occur when we import from one file format to another file format (here .g being the native format). They might also occur due to imprecise arithmetic, modelling transformations, designers’ fault, programming bugs, etc. Some of these are inevitable. Thus we require some programmatic method to heal meshes which are defective. There are quite a few features already present to heal meshes, but these are not sufficient. Hence, the project. Existing features include: removal of unused and exactly duplicate vertices, dangling edges, decimation of edges, and fusing of equivalent faces. The features that will added are: checking manifold connectivity, removal of gaps, T - joints, overlaps, large holes, and degenerate triangles.</p>\n",

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>\n<p>The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.</p>\n<p>Beside this we also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award or the Austrian National Innovation Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org - Beyond one Hour of Code) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. More over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

In addition to that, users can search for Scratch programs inside the app and select programs they would like to convert. Those Scratch programs are then converted by the server into Pocket Code programs that can be executed on their mobile device. On the server-side, the web service should act as a central hub for any kind of client applications being planned in the future.

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.</p>\n<h3>Who is using cBioPortal?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">public instance of cBioPortal</a> is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 1,500 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal (<a href=\"http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210\" target=\"_blank\">Gao et al. Sci.

The project starts from downloading human proteins in all isoforms from ensembl and blast them against all PDB sequences. The alignments will be parsed and stored into carefully designed databases. A JSON based API will be built upon the database via predefined methods in database query, and cBioPortal obtained the alignments from the exposed API. A pipeline will also be constructed to update the alignments weekly. Once new structures from PDB were released, the pipeline initiate automatically to update the alignments on the updated structures. The updated alignments were stored into the database and a regression test was applied to check the correctness on a validation set. Performance, robustness, reliability and developing feasibility were all considered in the proposal.</p>\n",

Currently, cBioPortal has a multitude of information on DNA and RNA, but their information on protein levels derives from protein arrays, a technology that has severe limitations relative to mass spectrometry. Clinical Proteomic Tumor Analysis Consortium (CPTAC) has performed mass spectrometry on the patient samples for TCGA tumors and it also includes information on post-translational modifications. I propose to integrate this information with the cBioPortal visualization interface. This involves extending their database with protein abundances and PTMs based on the CPTAC data and updating the cBioPortal interface with a new tab for post-translational modifications and updating existing tabs to accommodate the new protein data. By providing this upgrade, a tool that helps both scientists and doctors see personal and population biology at a glance will gain a new dimension.</p>\n",

CERN is one of the world’s largest and most exciting centers for fundamental physics research. Experiments at CERN have probed the fundamental nature of matter and the forces which affect it. CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web (<a href=\"http://info.cern.ch\" target=\"_blank\">http://info.cern.ch</a>), invented by Tim Berners-Lee. The SFT group's efforts, like most of CERN's current activities, are directed towards the world’s highest-energy elementary particle accelerator - the Large Hadron Collider (LHC, <a href=\"http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html\" target=\"_blank\">http://public.web.cern.ch/public/en/lhc/lhc-en.html</a>) and its experiments. There are four large experiments at the LHC, which seek to expand the frontiers of knowledge and complete our understanding of the constituents of matter and their interactions, of the conditions in the first instants after the Big Bang and of the differences between matter and anti-matter. During 2012, ATLAS and CMS announced the discovery of a new boson, which has been confirmed recently to have the properties of a Higgs boson - similar to the one required by the Standard Model of Particle Physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge. Operating the LHC and running each experiment requires a large amount of software. A large part of this software is common and open source. The open source software spans the range from system software to more specialized physics-oriented tools and toolkits.</p>\n<p>The projects to which students can contribute span several software projects:  SixTrack, accelerator simulation; the Geant4/Geant-V detector simulation toolkit\nthe ROOT software framework for storing and analyzing the data of the LHC experiments including machine learning software; \nCERNVM, a baseline Virtual Software Appliance for the participants of CERN LHC experiments.\n different computer platforms.</p>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level.  For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body.  These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance.  Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).</p>\n<p>Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>\n<p>As software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>\n",

For highly inflected languages like Latin and Greek, the task is particularly important for two reasons: 1. words often have a dozen or more possible forms (and, as opposed to go in English, this is the norm and not only a characteristic of irregularly formed words), and 2. small corpus size in general often demands that counts for a given feature like words be based on the broadest measure possible. Currently available Latin lemmatizers rely largely on dictionary-based look up methods, which is a good solution for frequently occurring and unambiguous forms. For my Google Summer of Code project, I propose to rewrite the CLTK Latin and Greek lemmatizers to handle a higher percentage of forms by applying a backoff tagging approach.</p>\n",

In recent years, discrete dynamic modeling has emerged as a powerful method of modeling and understanding biological systems. One type, boolean network models (which was initially used as a prototypical model of genetic regulatory networks), has been shown to be a tractable approach for modeling large-systems. A boolean network consists of a set of nodes whose state is binary and is determined only by other nodes in the network through Boolean functions. The simplicity and self-containment of these graphs makes it extremely fast to simulate these systems and is also a very realistic interpretation of how biological networks actually work. Unfortunately, no libraries yet exist for converting a visualization of a biological network into a logic gate visualization and vice-versa.</p>\n<p>Thus, the aim of this GSoC project is to develop a web-based tool that can visualize biological networks, and also transform these networks into a logic gate-based system.</p>\n",

What are the advantages to implement this interface into the Colibri\nproject? The grid operators have the possibility to inform the customer about e.g. the current\nenergy price, with this standardized interface. The customer can control his electrical consumers\nregarding the given information. Colibri with the OpenADR connection helps to automate this\nprocess on the customer side. The Colibri control module can reduce or increase the total power\nconsumption depending on to the information from the other smart grid agents. In the end this\nwill result in a more stable grid, because the energy producer and consumer will stand in an\ninterdependency. This also leads to an better usage of the energy resources which is a great benefit\nfor the society. Therefore it is a good idea to add this functionality to the Colibri project.</p>\n",

This project will be focused on improving Mir (Phobos’s upcoming science module) by adding a universal non-uniform random number generator (RNG) based on Tinflex. In contrast to the standard acceptance-rejection method, Tinflex requires only knowledge of the probability density function, its first two derivatives and a partitioning in intervals with at most one inflection point and is thus easier to use. Moreover a lot of common non-uniform random distributions will be added.</p>\n",

See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how <strong>BBC</strong> has created the <em>World Cup 2010</em> website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.</p>\n<p>Or, more recently, did you see that <strong>IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge</strong>?</p>\n<h3>DBpedia Spotlight</h3>\n<p><strong>DBpedia Spotlight</strong> is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that <em>Spotting</em>) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that <em>Disambiguation</em>). For example, <code>Washington</code> can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.</p>\n<h5>We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</h5>\n",

The service provides two different types of search APIs,  namely, Keyword Search and Prefix Search. The lookup service currently returns the query results in XML (default) and JSON formats and works on English language. It is based on a Lucene Index providing a weighted label lookup, which combines string similarity with a relevance ranking in order to find the most relevant matches for a given label.  As a part of the GSOC 2016, I am going to implement an improvised Lucene search module by generating indexes from SPARQL end points and RDF dumps.

          "abstract_html": "<p>Writing and maintaining software is challenging. Software is complex and keeping it\nbug-free remains an unsolved problem. Debian Stretch, the next Debian stable release, comprises 850 million lines of software source code. Code written in the C programming language accounts for 41% of the lines, which is more than in any other programming language. Debile, Debian’s package analysis platform, so far includes the CppCheck, Clang Static Analyzer, and Coccinelle tools for packages with C, C++, and Objective-C code. However, all of the tools perform static analyses, which can result in false positives. Too many reported false positives hinder adoption of the tools. To address this issue, I propose to integrate the KLEE tool into Debile. KLEE performs dynamic analysis on C programs and reports only true positives, i.e. real bugs. It does so by systematically exploring as many as possible execution paths in a given program. Errors that KLEE reports exist only along feasible execution paths, i.e. they correspond to real bugs in the program.</p>\n",

It supports the easy implementation of methods like Finite Elements, Discontinuous Galerkin, Finite Volumes, and Finite Differences.<br>\nThe underlying idea of DUNE is to create slim interfaces allowing an efficient use of legacy and/or new libraries. Modern C++ programming techniques enable different implementations of the same concept, i.e. grids or solvers,  using a common interface at a low overhead. Thus DUNE ensures efficiency in scientific computations and supports high-performance computing applications.</p>\n<h3>People</h3>\n<p>DUNE developers are professors, graduate students, post-docs, or people working in industry (e.g. as freelancers or consultants), currently located in Germany, UK, and Norway. With DUNE being a scientific software, they all share a scientific education and background. But their background differs (Mathematics, Computer Science, and Physics) as well as their application area (flow through porous media, linear elasticity, computational fluid dynamics, electro-magnetism, …).</p>\n<h3>History</h3>\n<p>DUNE started with an inaugurating meeting in February 2002. People from different German research groups of Universities in Bonn, Freiburg, and Heidelberg shared a common interest: developing an clean, slim, and modern open source framework for the parallel solution of PDEs which would allow reusing existent legacy software via a common interface based on generic programming techniques.</p>\n<h3>DUNE's main principles</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Separation of data structures and algorithms by abstract interfaces. This provides more functionality with less code and ensures maintainability and extendability of the framework.</li>\n<li>Static polymorphism allows the compiler to do more optimizations, in particular function inlining, which in turn allows the interface to have very small functions without a severe performance penalty.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need.</p>\n<p>It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable.</p>\n<p>The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free.</p>\n<p>The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome.</p>\n<p>Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.</p>\n",

But there is not yet a way to SOLVE revision conflicts. \nThe proposed solution is to create PHP library which would find lowest common ancestor(LCA) from DAG and perform a recursive 3 way merge with LCA as base file. The libraries would merge the updates in base file if no conflict arises.  However, for the case when a merge conflict occurs and has to be solved manually, a JS code editor library(CodeMirror) would be integrated with Plugin UI which would allow users to solve a merge conflict by displaying all the 3 files(Base, Theirs and Mine) in a 3 pane view.\nMore details: <a href=\"https://groups.drupal.org/node/508466#project35\" target=\"_blank\">https://groups.drupal.org/node/508466#project35</a></p>\n",

It is a threat to user in executing scripts from unknown sources especially scripts stored on remote server.  One way to provide authenticity and integrity is digital signature. I would like to work with EASE Eclipse community to extend project to provide signing and verifying script functionality to users. For providing signing feature, we can use java security API. It provides simple classes and methods to perform wide range of things like signing files using private key of user, export certificates, import certificates, verify signature, generating public and private keys, etc. User will be uploading his script on server, from where remote users can directly access such scripts through code and verify them before execution to know their credibility. I plan to provide several UI enhancements to support script signing efficiently. With successful completion of this project, EASE users will be able to judge nature of script before execution.</p>\n",

This site is a shared responsibility between CommOps and the Infrastructure team. Unlike most applications in the Fedora infrastructure, the Community Blog is not based off Ansible playbooks. <a href=\"https://www.ansible.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Ansible</a> is an open-source configuration management suite designed to make automation easier. Fedora already uses Ansible extensively across its infrastructure.</p>\n<p>My task would be migrating the Community Blog (and by extension, Fedora Magazine) to an Ansible-based set up and writing the documentation for any related SOPs.</p>\n<h3>The Why</h3>\n<p>In the current set up, the Community Blog and Fedora Magazine are managed separately from each other, and are managed by a single Infrastructure team member. By moving them to Ansible-based installations and merging the WordPress bases together, it adds the following benefits:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Easier for other Infrastructure team members to fix, maintain, or apply updates</li>\n<li>Automates by maintaining a single, Ansible-based WordPress install vs. two independent WordPress sites</li>\n<li>Creates a standard operating procedure for hosting blog platforms within Fedora (can be used for other extensions in the future)</li>\n</ol>\n",

Loklak’s API can be used to build twitter clones and client alike, one of them being loklak.net. One of the main features that’s pending in such a tool is the ease of adding angular micro services and modularizing the existing application to run on micro services. Alongside the data store of loklak is magnificent and provides the ability to build IoT platforms using the loklak server. In this proposal I would like to enhance the service architecture of loklak.net and build a proof of concept IoT application demonstrating the capabilities of the loklak server.</p>\n",

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.</p>\n<p>While our work originates from the OpenRISC processor, most of the development went into the processor ecosystem, like the toolchain, operating systems or userspace software. Beside that \"uncore\" hardware components are important to build a System-on-Chip. The focus of the FOSSi Foundation is therefore not on a single processor core, but we work on advancing the entire Free and Open Source Silicon (FOSSi) community. Our main ambition goes into building a community hub: <a href=\"http://www.librecores.org\" target=\"_blank\">LibreCores.org</a>. We currently bring it forward to become the main resource to find open source hardware components and publish such components and their ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.</p>\n<p>With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few <a href=\"http://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc16-ideas.html\" target=\"_blank\">ideas</a>, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.</p>\n<p>Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Bologna, Italy, on October 7-9.</p>\n",

This project will allow owners of Parallela boards to write and execute RISC-V programs with minimal effort from their side. The system will work out of the box with a prebuilt binary image ready to be placed in an SD card and users will be able to re-build it with minimal effort.

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

Currently, within FreeBSD, there is no such tool to perform regression testing of the TCP/IP network stack. The purpose of this project is to develop tests using a regression testing tool which can then be integrated with FreeBSD. The wire level regression test suite will exercise various states in the TCP/IP protocol suite, with both IPv4 and IPv6 support. Once integrated, the tool will also facilitate further development of such tests. The regression testing tool of choice here is Packetdrill. Packetdrill currently supports testing multiple scenarios for TCP/IP protocol suite within Linux. The existing Linux test suite implemented within Packetdrill will provide a basis for understanding, and implementation of the FreeBSD test suite.</p>\n",

High density of omnidirectional antennae per unit area directly translates to low SNR and thus bad wireless performance of our nodes. In the case where we only control one wireless node, not much can be done. We can scan the surroundings and choose the channel with a maximal SNR. But with a node database system, we can simultaneously optimize the spectrum allocation (both in terms of bandwidth as well as the center frequency, i.e. channel) across different nodes. SWOON is an algorithm that would maximize channel capacities over multiple nodes in close proximity.</p>\n",

With these information each node of the network is able calculate the paths to reach any other destination. \nThese messages are periodically generated, based on the configuration parameter that regulates the sending interval. A short period will make the network react rapidly but it will also cause a large overhead due to control messages.\nPop Routing is a recent technique that takes advantage of the knowledge of the network topology to find the optimal value for the OONF’s timers. Using Pop Routing every node computes its own “betweenness centrality” and uses it to calculate the optimal trade-off between convergence and overhead. The  algorithm has been developed at the UniTN and the needed libraries to compute the BC are available as free software.\nMy goal is to build a daemon that can calculate autonomously the BC of the network, together with a plugin for OONF that will use this value to tune its timers.</p>\n",

Moreover, the decoupling will allow netifd to manage devices of types which may even be unknown to netifd without the need to change the central UCI network device configuration in /etc/config/network. In this project, we will present a basic proof-of-concept module which outsources the control over Open vSwitch in OpenWrt to an external device handling entity. Specifically, we will realize a small daemon acting as a relay between the ovs command line tools and netifd's ubus device handler interface.

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.</p>\n",

In the past this sequence information consisted of a single reference sequence, which can be relatively easily visualised in a linear way. Today we often know multiple variants of a particular DNA sequence. The differences between the individual sequences are called polymorphisms and can range in size from variations of a single base pair (single nucleotide polymorphism = SNP) to variations involving long stretches of DNA.</p>\n<p>There are a number of approaches (and file formats) for formally encoding variants of genomic sequences and their relationships in the form of graphs. Unfortunately it is often difficult to visualise these graphs in a way which conveys the complex information yet is intuitively easy to understand. The goal of this project is to help in the visualisation of genomic sequences and their variations by providing a JavaScript module which generates visual representations of genomic sequence graphs. This module aims to display the information about all sequence variants in a single visualisation as elegantly as possible.</p>\n",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.</p>\n<p>The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as <a href=\"http://www.gpstk.org\" target=\"_blank\">GPSTk</a> or <a href=\"http://www.rtklib.com/\" target=\"_blank\">RTKLIB</a>).</p>\n",

The solution for this lies in the recently drafted IETF ARC (Authenticated Received Chain) protocol. From Mailman's point of view, ARC is a protocol that can help mitigate denial of service to subscribed addresses at Yahoo!, AOL, and other sites that have a <code>p = reject</code> DMARC policy. With Google too set to migrate to a DMARC <code>p=reject</code> policy in the near future, the importance of the ARC protocol has become more significant.Basically, setting up ARC would allow Mailman to securely register its handling of the message, thus allowing the set-up of a trust mechanism between Mailman and the involved MTAs and hence reducing the denial of service.</p>\n",

It surely will intend to provide more functionality atleast in terms of catching exceptions and provide suitable error messages, if possible, by using callback functions to handle such situations.\nFor the solution, I propose to use Boost.Python (if it’s acceptable in terms of License) because I already have worked with boost libraries (not with Python library but with some others) and I think boost can prove to be the perfect solution. I intend to fully complete the interface with Boost.Python and to modify every file to use it before end of GSoC.</p>\n",

This class of methods is based on the exact integration of the linear part of an initial value problem and this can help to mitigate the stiffness of a differential equation. My idea is to implement at least four methods, the two basic methods exponential Euler and exponential Rosenbrock-Euler, and then two advanced methods with adaptive time stepping, one from Runge-Kutta and one from Rosenbrock-type exponential integrator family. This is my initial idea, but I'm willing to take advice and expand the project during the work period.

At the core of the programme is the development of the open source DHIS software and the use of this application to strengthen country health information systems. The DHIS 2 software is used in more than 45 countries in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the South Pacific, and countries that have adopted DHIS 2 as their nation-wide HIS software include Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Rwanda, Ghana, Liberia, and Bangladesh. A rapidly increasing number of countries and organizations are starting up new deployments.

The naive perception is often that speech is built with words, and each word consists of phones. The reality is unfortunately very different. Speech is a dynamic process without clearly distinguished parts. It's always useful to get a sound editor and look into the recording of the speech and listen to it.\nAll modern descriptions of speech are to some degree probabilistic. That means that there are no certain boundaries between units, or between words. Speech to text translation and other applications of speech are never 100% correct. That idea is rather unusual for software developers, who usually work with deterministic systems. And it creates a lot of issues specific only to speech technology.\nThe system is intended to develop Language model and Acoustic model to be used for speech recognition of Malayalam Language.</p>\n",

As a result, most of the single cell and neural network models have low RAPT (reproducibility, accessibility, portability and transparency). This has slowed the progress of using biophysically and anatomically detailed neural network models in understanding the brain function in health and disease. In a period of three months during the GSoC placement, I would like to contribute to the Open Source Brain (OSB) Initiative which aims to increase the RAPT of single cell and neural network models. The project will extend the initial work by the OSB on converting the thalamocortical network model by Traub et al. (2005) to the simulator-independent model format, NeuroML2. Firstly, I propose to annotate and implement the tests for spiking behaviour of Traub model cells which are converted to the NeuroML2 format. Secondly, I propose to create a generic Python-based package which can generate different configurations of cortical networks in the NeuroML2 format  and combine unique network components from different cortical network projects.</p>\n",

With enough of these outputs we can begin to perform what is known as reconstructing the black box in the field of parameter space analysis (Konyha et al.). One method to do this is through trial and error, where a researcher sets the input parameters to specific values based upon their experience, and collects the outputs as sample points to investigate later on (Sedlmair et al.). This is a computationally expensive method for exploring parameter space which limits the effectiveness of the program overall.</p>\n<p>This project represents an effort to update the Parameter Space Exploration (PSE) tool so that it can be used effectively for exploring the parameter space associated with each included large-scale brain model. This achieved would effectively reconstruct the black box of the model which is vital for our understanding of its validity, and supports ongoing work to better understand the original basis for our model, the human brain.</p>\n",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2016 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, NASA Langley Research Center, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

This is done by symbolically executing the code block via SPF over JPF in order to generate path constraints for each possible path that a program may take. The path constraints are then put into canonical form and analyzed. Level of refinement of the path constraints dictate the level at which we model programs i.e. If we do not refine the path constraints at all, the program is modeled on a syntactical level. If we stop refinement early, the program is modeled on a semantic level but syntactical structure of the program is still considered. If we  completely refine the path constraints and put them into canonical form, the program is modeled on a semantic level with no consideration towards the syntactical structure of the program. This gives us options on applications of fingerprinting for programs. Further research in this field could result in semantic patterns not just being observed but rather analyzed. Applications of this analysis include the possible creation of a semantic auto-complete for programmers.</p>\n",

Further in the accompanying theoretical work of Giannakopoulou et al.[1] is shown, that this interfaces are k-full, in case they are safe, permissive, and tight for all method sequences of length up to k, k ϵ ℕ. The evaluation part of the current PSYCO implementation shows that the choice of k heavily influences the runtime behavior of PSYCO. Further it is argued, that it is possible to choose k to a relative small value after a manual analysis of the source code. During my project I will implement a symbolic search on the symbolic transition system produced by JDART to generate possible good choices for k in an automated manner. Apart of the choice of k the symbolic search output can also be used to prove invariants on the analyzed components, e.g., the absence of assertion violations.</p>\n",

The aim of concolic execution is to explore additional behavior in the program by generating input values which will result in a different path being taken through a program (or method). The result of concolic execution is a constraints tree, i.e., a tree with its inner nodes reflecting the decisions that were made during the execution of the program. The nodes on the trees are labeled as: OK if the method was regularly exited, ERROR if there was an exception, or DONT_KNOW if no valuation could be generated for the respective path.</p>\n<p>Currently, the constraints tree is represented only as a plain text file which makes identifying the nodes and the statuses of leaves extremely hard in such a simplistic representation. To provide a better user experience, I will develop a web interface to visualize the constraints trees generated by JDart. At a very basic level, a user will have an intuitive overview on the whole generated trees. At a later stage, I will enable interactive operations on the web interface, e.g. letting user select on which part of a tree JDart should focus on.</p>\n",

These are either stored in a predetermined directory, or listed in a config file.</p>\n<p>--Minecraft does it's start-up routines. The user loads a world.</p>\n<p>--Each tick (world update) (or X ticks, determined by efficiency needs), the mod executes the rules.</p>\n<p>--The rules call functions in the mod's Drools API.

Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. Jenkins core is open-source (<a href=\"http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\" target=\"_blank\">MIT License</a>)</p>\n<p>In 2015, Jenkins surpassed 100,000 known installations making it the most widely deployed automation server. The Jenkins project has a big community (about 300 active contributors), which includes many people working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, community management and localization activities. In the project we release new Jenkins version almost every week, a <a href=\"(https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/LTS+Release+Line\" target=\"_blank\">stabilization release</a> every three months and maintain the backward compatibility for more than eight years.</p>\n<p>In 2016 the Jenkins project is planning to release Jenkins 2.0. This is a major effort targeting the user experience in wide terms. It includes not only user interface changes, but also availability improvements and major new features like Pipeline-as-code. The activity involves all components of Jenkins: core, plugins, website and internal automation infrastructure.</p>\n<p>This year we invite students to join the Jenkins community and to work together on the ongoing Jenkins 2.0 activities and other medium-term projects.</p>\n",

The reason for this is that Natural Earth dataset has categorically arranged data which is required for step by step rendering of lower levels. Apart from this the rendered data should be styled so as to match the OSM theme and tiling support must be added on the server and client side.</p>\n<p>For the medium level tiles, rendering must be performed using the OSM dataset. OSM dataset gives us many small chunks and nodes for a particular geographic data item. These chunks and nodes need to be filtered and reduced to a manageable size for each specific level so as to get optimal performance and less screen clutter.</p>\n<p>Rendering of higher level tiles can be improved by adding rendering support for roof-types and textures tags of buildings.</p>\n",

Often, when selecting files using Ctrl+A or the selection tool, we find that we need to select only a subset of the required files we have selected. This leads to the unwieldy operation of removing files from our selection. Of course, the common workaround is to create a new folder and to put all the items in this folder prior to copying, but this is a very inefficient and very slow process if large files need to be copied. Moreover Ctrl+Click requires fine motor skills to not lose the entire selection of files.</p>\n<p>This is an original project with a novel solution to this problem. My solution is to add a virtual folder in all KIO applications, where the links to files and folders can be temporarily saved. The files and folders are \"staged\" on this virtual folder. Files can be added to this by using all the regular file management operations such as Move, Copy and Paste, or by drag and drop. Hence, complex file operations such as moving files across many devices can be made easy by staging the operation before performing it.</p>\n",

However, C, Sphinx C--, C++, Free Pascal, Forth, among other high-level languages and compilers, can also be used in user application development (although FASM is strongly preferred).</p>\n<p>The OS features support for USB and PATA devices, popular network, sound and graphics cards, FAT12/16/32, partical support for NTFS and ext2/3/4 file systems, read-only support for ISO9660, XFS file systems and SATA devices, a rich set of applications, that includes text editors, image viewer, graphical editor, textual web browser, and over 30 games.</p>\n<p>KolibriOS is VERY light on system requirements, using as little as 1MB of disk space and 8MB RAM to run. In terms of processing power, Intel®'s original Pentium® (P5 microarchitecture) or compatible CPU is sufficient to fully enjoy KolibriOS.

As it is, when you write code on their website and press submit, the code is sent to their server, compiled and the result is sent back. The problem with this, is that it doesn't show the entire capabilities of the language. For instance if you write a program that prints a message every second for 10 seconds, it will return that message printed ten times in an instant. What I want to do by using Emscripten is to have a real time tutorial, so that after the server sends back the result, it will actually print the message every one second, for ten seconds. I will also want to create a second tutorial that implements SDL as well. SDL is a language that can create shapes and interacts with keyboard inputs and the mouse. There already is compatibility between Ceu and SDL and there is also compatibility between SDL and Emscripten. The challenge is to create a synergy with all three languages. I believe this to be feasible, because you can transform a Ceu program into a C program that can then be compiled with Emscripten.</p>\n",

It can be used to power Instant Messaging, VoIP/WebRTC signalling, Internet of Things communication - or anywhere you need a standard HTTP API for publishing and subscribing to data whilst tracking the conversation history.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://matrix.org\" target=\"_blank\">Matrix.org</a> defines the standard, and provides open source reference implementations of Matrix-compatible Servers, Clients, Client SDKs and Application Services to help you create new communication solutions or extend the capabilities and reach of existing ones.</p>\n<h3>What is Matrix’s Mission?</h3>\n<p>Matrix’s initial goal is to fix the problem of fragmented IP communications: letting users message and call each other without having to care what app the other user is on - making it as easy as sending an email.</p>\n<p>The longer term goal is for Matrix to act as a generic HTTP messaging and data synchronisation system for the whole web - allowing people, services and devices to easily communicate with each other, empowering users to own and control their data and select the services and vendors they want to use.</p>\n<h3>What does this mean for users?</h3>\n<p>The aim is to provide an analogous ecosystem to email - one where you can communicate with pretty much anyone, without caring what app or server they are using, using whichever app &amp; server you chose to use, and use a neutral identity system like an e-mail address or phone number to discover people to talk to.</p>\n<h3>How is Matrix currently being used?</h3>\n<p><a href=\"http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">Lots of different clients</a> have already been written by the community, as well as several bridges to exiting services (IRC, Slack, libpurple etc). In fact, a user visiting #matrix on freenode might be communicating with libpurple or Slack users via Matrix - without even realising it!</p>\n<p>You can try it yourself by joining a room like <a href=\"https://vector.im/beta/#/room/#matrix:matrix.org\" target=\"_blank\">#matrix:matrix.org</a> via any Matrix-client - see the  <a href=\"http://matrix.org/docs/projects/try-matrix-now.html\" target=\"_blank\">\"try matrix now\"</a> page for suggestions!</p>\n",

Distribution of models in the form of open-source modules is needed to initiate freer discourse in the scientific world, where the development of interdisciplinary fields has served to the end of establishing specificity of focus instead of fostering a more holistic and collaborative approach to investigation.The McGill Space Institute (MSI) is an organization located at the crossroads of astronomy, biology, and earth sciences, embodying an archetype characterized by transparency, sharing, and collaboration: facets reflected in open-source culture. By developing three pieces of code for a model of an important microbial metabolism, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, we can meet the interests of MSI researchers from all walks. In making a single core model available to these three sub-groups of workers in formats that are compatible with their existing working methods and languages of choice, it is possible to set a precedent in the encouragement of transdisciplinary collaboration in science.</p>\n",

This feature can boost the memory management in App inventor by assigning memory when needed. \nThe proposal also marks the enhancement of file access.

At present, there are no Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter ROS packages with such broad range of features. The existing <em>slam_gmapping</em> ROS package, which is based on gmapping from OpenSLAM, uses only grid-based maps from laser data. The implementation from the MRPT library can work simultaneously with multiple instances of grid-based maps, point maps, beacon maps and combinations of them. Moreover, MRPT provides several types of Particle Filters such as PF with Standard and Optimal [Grisetti et al., 2007] Proposals, as well as an Approximate Optimal Sampling [Blanco et al., 2008a]. Thus, existing <em>slam_gmapping</em> package features only a subset of this functionality and robotics community will benefit greatly from being able to use implementation offered by MRPT library. Therefore, the goal of this project is to provide MRPT-powered ROS packages for Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter.</p>\n",

The result by the end of summer should be a fully functional, robust and usuable graph-based SLAM algorithm ready to be used by researchers and roboticists. We provide an overal timeline, with intermediate milestones to make sure that we meet the goals of the project. The proposal begins with an introduction to the graph-based formulation and lists already implemented and successful graphSLAM strategies.

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?</p>\n<h4>Minimal Engine</h4>\n<p>Our engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.</p>\n<h4>Extensibility</h4>\n<p>Any content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.</p>\n<p>Creating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.</p>\n",

The goal is to implement a component to migrate a store from the mbox format to maildir format. \nIn order to achieve the goal a new store should be created and all the messages from all the folders of the old store should be moved to respective folders of the new store in maildir format. The folder hierarchy of the old store needs to be maintained in the new store. The message copying should be carried out in a worker using OS.File to prevent other tasks from getting locked up for long.</p>\n",

Cytoscape is open-source software that is popular (6350 citations as of March 22nd 2016) for the visualization of networks. As scientists work with increasing amounts of data and the expectation of reproducible computational analyses increases, many users of network visualization programs are turning to scripted analyses instead of using a graphical user interface (GUI). \nCytoscape has an application programming interface (API) that uses the Representational State Transfer (REST) to send information between Cytoscape and different programs. The package RCy3  allows users to connect R to Cytoscape allowing them to script their visualizations. There are two ways the package would be enhanced: 1) by enabling the use of Cytoscape plugins programmatically through their API, and  2) by creating robust walkthroughs of the code necessary to use RCy3 and other packages for reproducible network visualizations. The walkthroughs would include approaches relevant to many Cytoscape users and incorporate the programmatic use of plugins with developed function.</p>\n",

To further expand from this software, I will implement a standalone software that converts CellDesigner annotation to SBML Layout and vice versa. It will allow the user to convert CellDesigner annotation into SBML format without CellDesigner. Also the same layout will be held in CellDesigner even when a model is created with another software (i.e. SBML model with Layout). From above, implementing this software will provide interconvertibility between CellDesigner and SBML Layout and remove redundancy for users.</p>\n",

BioPax is a standard used for the representation of biological pathways. This standard has been traditionally used to describe structural and basic qualitative behavioral aspects of a biological design. While BioPax represents qualitative models, there are standards that describe quantitative models, namely the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). SBML is a standard for the representation of mathematical models of biological systems. SBML is built around core constructs that describe quantitative processes such as reactions. However, there are package extensions that allow for additional features. The Qualitative Models (qual) extension specifically allows SBML to describe qualitative models, which makes interconversion between both formats possible.</p>\n",

I envision a set of tutorials moving from a level just beyond the demos, to a tutorial that details the creation of both mobile and web apps. \nBased on the current demos, I feel that there are enough examples of possible Cytoscape.js based webapps but each needs more documentation. There is very little guidance provided to new users as to why each demo works the way it does. To use a car metaphor, it seems like the demos are oriented more for going from 60 - 100 mph than 0-60. \nAs mentioned in the provided description, each demo exhibits a single concept rather than tying them all together.

To rig it with some new features and make enhancements in it I want to do a project in this summers which will aim at giving new capabilities to Nmap as well as hunt down its existing bugs. These features and bugs hunting will take up the Nmap to a next level where it will be even more powerful. This project will have many sub-projects in it with their individual deadlines and milestones, at the same time many bugs also will be corrected by me, as there can be many number of bugs I will maintain a list of bugs where they will be prioritized with the help and recommendation of mentor and community. Few of the sub-projects which are either enhancement or new feature have been mentioned in the project proposal while some of them will come on the way of this three month of coding period so depending upon their urgency, need and complexity I will take up them with an appropriate deadline assigned by mentor.</p>\n",

RiPPs can be divided in more than 20 sub-classes and have a wide range of biological functions:  among others, they can work as antibiotics, nutritional additives or food preservatives. Thus, the use of RiPPs as drugs is increasing and several RiPP derivatives are already in advanced phases of clinical trials.\nIn this project, prediction modules for a number of RiPP clusters will be developed. Working together with the mentors, who can provide technical and scientific advice, antiSMASH plug-ins will be created to allow researchers to identify the RiPP precursor gene, identify the cleavage sites of the core peptide and predict further modifications to its sctructure. With these plug-ins, we hope to accelerate all the research involving RiPPs and consequently, shorten the time “between the bench and the bed” for possible new drugs.</p>\n",

The methods for solving these different tasks can be very different and highly targeted for that special object type.

Most of it is carried out by scientists who need to tweak their tools in order to get their experiments to run, and almost none of it is shared. To reduce the need for such redundant development efforts, we created Open Ephys as a centralized hub for tool sharing. \"Ephys\" is short for \"electrophysiology,\" which is the most common technique for recording the activity of neurons. Our main focus is on making it easier for neuroscientists to acquire data from many neurons simultaneously, and the Open Ephys GUI is the open-source, modular application that makes this possible. Our GUI, which takes inspiration from audio production software such as Ableton Live, is the most widely used open-source application of its kind. We're looking for talented  students to help make the GUI more robust and user friendly.</p>\n",

Galaxy is a user-friendly web platform originally dedicated to life sciences data analysis. If Galaxy provides amazing functionalities to enhance transparency, accessibility and reproducibility of data analysis related processes, there is still opportunities to provide more reproducibility and flexibility in the manner of using this web platform.This project idea is to integrate the Go-Docker system with Galaxy. Integration is to be done in two ways. First, to develop a “Go-Docker Galaxy tool” which will allow the possibility to create / use new on demand “tools” in a Galaxy instance without being an admin and without going to the system black matter. Second, to develop a “Go-Docker executor/runner” which can be used as any other scheduler (i.e. SGE, Torque …).</p>\n",

It will absolutely help the cooperation between scientists due to they can create their tools based on or cooperate with others’ more easily. Our project has three main goals. The first is to communicate with GA4GH community so as to decide the APIs standard and their implementations.

In some applications, adjustments to nominal paths must be made based on sensor feedback or operator input. The issues were raised at ROSCON 2015 . The specific application driving this need is robotic assembly using end-effector force feedback, where parts such as computer board components need placement in holes or sockets with tight clearances, and the object locations may vary considerably with a need to locate them using vision systems. Achieving reactive and adaptive path planning may require extensions to several parts of ROS and ROS-Industrial, including the MoveIt! or Descartes path planners, the ROS control layer, or the Simple Message protocol to hardware robot controllers. Development can take place without actual force sensors or cameras, using simulated sources of the high-level outputs of these sensors in terms of small adjustments that affect the trajectories. The key software objective is to put in place a method to adjust trajectories after they have been nominally planned, rather than focusing on sensor processing.</p>\n",

At present day CNN has been successfully applied in various fields of Computer Vision, for example: image classification [1, 2, 3], semantic segmentation [4], object detection [5], human pose estimation [6], etc. \nAlso some of the recent researches have tried to apply discriminating power of CNN for visual tracking purposes: [7, 8, 9, 10, 11]. Almost all of them outperform state-of-art tracking algorithms (like TLD [12], KCF [13]) in terms of accuracy, but lose in terms of speed.\nOne of the most recent successful trackers based on CNN are MDNet and GOTURN. Though MDNet has been evaluated as a top – accuracy tracker (1-st place on VOT2015), it suffers from low performance (~1 FPS) due to CNN online learning. While GOTURN can run on around 100 FPS maintaining high accuracy and robustness (close to MDNet). Good speed/accuracy tradeoff makes GOTURN one of the most promising next-generation trackers. So this proposal aims to implement GOTURN tracker in OpenCV library.</p>\n",

Among all the available algorithms, phase-shifting profilometry (PSP) is one of the most popular and I believe OpenCV would benefit from its implementation. Unfortunately, PSP does not perform well on dynamic scenes since it belongs to time-multiplexing methods. Indeed, successive patterns are not deformed in the same way which leads to reconstruction errors. To reduce reconstruction errors due to motion, scientists had the idea to combine PSP with Fourier transform profilometry (FTP), a one-shot method that uses the same patterns. My goal for GSoC 2016 is to add PSP, FTP and Fourier assisted phase-shifting profilometry (FAPS) to OpenCV.  Spatial phase unwrapping, which is essential to PSP, FTP and FAPS, will be coded as an independent module due to its broad number of applications. Finally, as a proof of concept of scene understanding from structured light, an automatic piecewise-planar surfaces detection will be tested on the results provided by Fourier transform profilometry.</p>\n",

Modern mobile devices allow new features like key exchange via QR or NFC, and support for secret keys stored on Yubikey devices.</p>\n<p>On its own, OpenKeychain supports encryption, decryption, signature generation, and signature verification of files and text. In addition to stand-alone use, it comes with an API which makes crypto operations available for other apps. We are actively working together with K-9 Mail to bring secure email based on the OpenPGP standard to Android.</p>\n",

The correctness of the resulting routes is not ensured. Furthermore, many of the already mapped routes are in need for validation and correction. The proposed GSoC project will provide the functionality for a more convenient editing of public transport routes either by creating new ways between stops with a routing algorithm or by replicating them from existing public transport routes. Furthermore, it will elaborate criteria of route correctness and validate the existing routes against those criteria. There are Python scripts written by Polyglot to find ways that belong to a route described by its stops and to compare a given route to an already existing route. However, their installation requires additional steps, so for a better usability an extended version of this functionality needs to be implemented as part of the JOSM public transport plugin.</p>\n",

In the long term, we aspire to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world.</p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven content creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Oppia provides tools that enable teachers, bloggers, professors and enthusiasts to create new explorations without needing to know how to code. Our exploration editor helps creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, and allows the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). We also hope to facilitate the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

Coloring each Voxel might present another metadata and additionally creating an animation in time gives the opportunity to introduce a further variable. \n Users will be able to interact with the visualization, customizing the metadata on the Voxel and filtering data according to specific settings. \n As input data, I'm considering telecommunication data from \"Telecom Italia Big Data Challenge 2015\". \nMy idea is to create first the visualization environment and further import the data in a database to allow users to query the database for particular data. \nMoreover, depending on the time also would be interesting to allow users to import their own data set in a specific format to share the view on a specific globe with other people.</p>\n",

Idea of this proposal is to enable the JGrasstools library to serve as geoprocessing engine using the WPS standard implemented in the ZOO-Project (<a href=\"http://zoo-project.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://zoo-project.org/</a>). The main task in this proposal would the preparation and conversion of field data from geopaparazzi projects to Web-GIS platform enabling data analysis and sharing. The project will demonstrate and document the methods to deploy WPS using JGrasstools as the geoprocessing engine. As a future possibility, the project would facilitate Web-GIS platform with rich set functionality especially in hydrology and water management needs.  The results of this project will be useful for deploying Web application for Monitoring and Evaluation (M&amp;E) needs.</p>\n",

The aim of this project is to use the extracted information for implementing Sorting by different attributes(such as date taken, color, size, person) and also for creating multiple views in Gallery. The different views that I have thought of are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Photo Calendar</strong> (Multiple views: Year, Month, Day) (Proposed) <strong>(Highest Preference)</strong></li>\n<li><strong>Location View</strong> (Based on the location) (Proposed)</li>\n</ul>\n",

Another button will be added for a restoration of the previous POIs after a visit.</p>\n<p>Once the action is confirmed the POIs will be deployed in the LG and the user will be able to see them in the screens.</p>\n<p>In order to build the user POIs set, I will develop an Android App where the user can define its own POIs. This information will be stored in the user Google Drive account and the URL will be the one the PW beacon will advertise.</p>\n<p>So when the scanner detects the PW beacon and confirms the action, the system will connect to this URL and will download the POIs stored in it.</p>\n<p>To sum up, this project will have 2 Android Apps: one to be running on LG (connection, interaction and restoration of user POIS) and another one for the visitor mobile (config and customization of own POIS and PW Beacon).</p>\n",

Very simple animations can often efficiently communicate abstract ideas, especially in technical fields. However, with many of the currently available tools, designing even simple animations can involve heavy design loads which technically inclined creators are not always eager to carry. This project aims to solve this issue by providing simple tools to create expressive GIFs by writing small scripts. The scripting language provides means to describe technical animations by typing code, instead of relying on click-and-drag interfaces of most design programs, which is in fact more practical when the animation we intend to create involves objects describable mathematically or programmatically.\nThe core tool will thus be a small program which takes a script written by the user and outputs the GIF animation described in the script.</p>\n",

Generally, the more data the better conclusions can be drawn. However, many projects suffer from having not enough volunteers and therefore collected data. This projects goal is to dramatically reduce the barrier for non-technical people to become volunteers. To achieve this goal, a serial communication via headphone socket will be established. With WebRTC the signals can be captured in a browser, making installation of addtional software unnecessary.</p>\n",

Instead of downloading all files from the the main repository, client would download them from remote store, which could greatly decrease load from the main server.

Dimension reduction algorithms are either nonlinear or linear transformations, both categories providing distinct benefits and shortcomings. Existing implementations of any dimension reduction algorithm work by decomposing either some subset of an N-by-P “observation matrix” delineating the N “observations” of a system with P coordinates or with a P-by-P correlation matrix. Functions in MDAnalysis avoid creating such a matrix as it would proscribe users from analyzing very large MD simulations on a workstation or laptop. The goal of this project will be to implement Principal Component Analysis and diffusion maps in MDAnalysis such that both methods are accessible to aforementioned users.</p>\n",

Umbrella Sampling (US) is an MD technique which involves performing a series of simulations in which a ‘reaction coordinate’ – such as distance between two molecules – is restrained to different values. Simulation data can be combined, usually using the WHAM method, to produce a ‘potential of mean force’ (PMF) profile that shows the energy landscape along the chosen coordinate. Several implementations of WHAM exist, but require input files of specific formats which may differ from that obtained directly from the simulation, dependent on the simulation engine used. Additionally, it would be convenient be able to calculate the PMF alongside analysis of the trajectory such as offered by MDAnalyisis. However, MDAnalysis does not yet have tools specifically for dealing with and analysing US simulations. This project aims to introduce capabilities for loading US simulation sets, including a generalised tool for loading auxiliary data files, and performing WHAM and other basic analysis.</p>\n",

For this we need to be able to use with ease as many resources as we have possible.

This can be achieved by including optimized operations from current NVidia frameworks, as well as optimizing or designing GPU code which resides in the framework’s backend. Furthermore, analysis and optimization of multi-gpu code, in addition with a consideration of a multi-node/gpu design, would prove themselves useful for this cause.</p>\n",

Implementing coroutines will be the main feature of this project, as this feature offers more new methods than the other features. PEP 465 shows that Matrix multiplication is already used more often than bitwise operations in numeric libraries. Also, having coroutines with async and await syntax as well as enhanced unpacking options, the possibility that Python 3.5 syntax will be used in upcoming code rises. Therefore, an implementation of these features in PyPy3 will definitely increase compatibility to future Python 3 programs. In order to support PyPy’s Python 3 compatibility even further, other new features of Python 3.5 and 3.4 will be implemented after finishing the three PEPs if there is enough time, starting with the enum module of 3.4 and continuing with PEP 461 to allow support of the % formatting operator to bytes and bytearrays.</p>\n",

With Pandas readily available for most users, this is tedious fait accompli for users, since the core data model for PySAL's API was designed before Pandas existed. While newer projects have attempted to extend Pandas for geographic data, those packages have difficult-to-install dependencies that make them inaccessible for many end users, and make design decisions which the author thinks are somewhat suboptimal for PySAL's use case. Therefore, I propose to specify and implement a tabular spatial data model in Python leveraging Pandas dataframes directly, rather than through subclassing. This follows in the spatialite idea that spatial data is first data, then spatial. Thus, tooling must focus on enabling spatial operations directly on Pandas dataframes by exploiting column dtype information and dispatching appropriately, instead of a subclassing approach. In the end, this project would result in a simpler data model for PySAL.</p>\n",

Along with an accurate implementation of L-PCA and its adaptation to Rician noise, the project will also aim at optimising the implementation of L-PCA using Cython. \nAfter implementing L-PCA, a method for robust brain extraction needs to be developed. DIPY’s median OTSU based implementation is known not work so well with non-echo planar diffusion imaging (non-EPI dMRI) data. There are few possible ways to improve this, one is to generate labels and have weighted median OTSU. Another idea involves using some version of patch based segmentation using image library constructed from previously annotated images and using it as a reference for the subsequent extraction.</p>\n",

Postcopy migration is used for virtual machines which have a high memory dirtying rate, (higher than the bandwidth of the network that will be used to perform migration). The disadvantage of postcopy migration is, if there is a network failure then we are left with an inconsistent vm at both the source and the destination side.\nThe aim of this project is to recover from the network failure, and complete the migration process. The project will include completing the process of sending the leftover memory pages.\nProject would start by making sure that the threads do not fail at both the source and destination end. This would be followed by re-establishing the network connection between the source and the destination. After this is done, the migration process is restarted. The vCPUs on the destination side were suspended due to page faults, so these pages are transferred first. Followed by the rest of the leftover pages on the source side.</p>\n",

By relying on a hidden/latent variable, these models are able to switch among several processes for the conditional volatility and therefore, account for structural break in the volatility dynamics. MSGARCH have gained a huge interest in the \ffinancial risk management community over the recent years as they are better at forecasting volatility and provide more accurate risk measures.  The package will follow the structure of rugarch since this is one of the most used packages for volatility modeling. The core will be implemented in C++ while simple R functions will facilitate usage of the package. Currently, no R package is available to estimate these models.</p>\n",

The project is basically divided into 3 phases involving segmentation, data collection and learning. Segmentation is done using fast and robust template matching. Details of template matching are mentioned in the proposal. Phase 2 will involve deciding various gestures and corresponding data collection of these gestures from the mentioned NewsScape database. Phase 2 will also involve feature extraction. Three different kinds of features will be extracted. Firstly the template features used to segment the hand and head will be used , secondly the features generated using motion history image of the segmented hand will be used and finally the relative positions of the hands and heads will be used. These 3 types of features will be stored and used for learning. Learning will involve using  2dSvd for dimensionality reduction without losing time information. Various classifiers will b used to learn the reduced data and the one the the highest accuracy will be chosen.</p>\n",

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism. More cutting-edge software engineering technologies are being included in RoboComp to simplify the life-cycle of robotics components and to facility the deployment of very large networks of components that more a more start to resemble a \"biological\" computational device.</p>\n",

The implementation will support both real images and rendered images from CAD model. The implementation will be based on CUDA library and allow user to train and test his models. Also, a caffe independent pure RoboComp based implementation for forward pass will be developed for a selected CNN. Another component based on open scene graph will designed that would allow reading of CAD models and interfacing with current RoboComp simulation framework. Selection of rich textured CAD models is an crucial for any detection algorithm.

In addition, RTEMS is designed to support embedded applications with the most stringent real-time requirements while being compatible with open standards such as POSIX. RTEMS includes optional functional features such as TCP/IP and file systems while still offering minimum executable sizes under 20 KB in useful configurations.\nThe RTEMS Project is the collection of individuals, companies, universities, and research institutions that collectively maintain and enhance the RTEMS software base. As a community, we are proud to be popular in the space application software and experimental physics communities. RTEMS has been to Venus, circles Mars, is aboard Curiosity, is in the asteroid belt, and is on its way to Jupiter. It is in use in many high energy physics research labs around the world. There are many RTEMS users who do not belong to the space or physics communities, but our small part in contributing to basic scientific knowledge makes us proud.</p>\n",

A Capture Engine buffers trace data in SMP-safe manner and records it on the target. RTEMS uses its own format for the traces. In this project we propose to modify the tracing framework to generate traces in the standardized Common Trace Format (CTF). CTF is a bit-packed trace-format used by a range of monitoring and visualisation tools (eg. Babeltrace). In the next phase, I will implement live-tracing functionality over a set of popular transport mechanisms(eg. USB, JTAG). Using LTTng tools we can visualise and analyse these live-traces on the host. I will focus on measuring and minimizing the overhead added due to tracing.</p>\n",

The topic is complex: a Ruby tightly corseted by types would not be true to the essence of the language.</p>\n<p>Under a gradual typing discipline, type annotations can be specified at will: interesting parts of the program can be given explicit types and their type safety checked statically.

Instead, Ruby programmers use Array. In fact, Array offers List like methods such as insert, delete, push back and more.

We say two self-maps of projective space are equivalent if there is an element of the Projective Linear Group that conjugates one to the other. The following two algorithms should be implemented, in order to create more functionality in moduli space.\nThe first algorithm would be that given two endomorphisms of projective space determine if they are conjugate. In other words, determine if they are in the same class in the moduli space. If they are, also return the PGL element that conjugates one to the other.The second algorithm would be that given an endomorphism of projective space to compute a reduced form. This conjugation would that makes the coefficients small. There is already an algorithm implemented to return the minimal model in terms of resultant, but the coefficients can be non-optimal. The simplest approach would be to reduce the binary form describing the fixed points or if the binary form describing the fixed points is not sufficiently nice then reduce the binary form for points of period n for some small n.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>A Scalable language</h3>\n<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts. Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.</p>\n<h3>Object-Oriented</h3>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.</p>\n<h3>Functional</h3>\n<p>Even though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n<h3>Seamless Java Interop</h3>\n<p>Scala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Fun</h3>\n<p>Maybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”</p>\n",

The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in\nefficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30).\nScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers\n(out of an all-time pool of over 110), working together on a codebase of\n2,400,000 lines of code.

A major refactor of code is required to make the development process better and improve the user experience.

I also aim to develop a new parameter framework to improve the syntax of the API which is exposed to the user via SWIG. This would also make installing Shogun much easier (which is an important priority of Shogun community) as base library will be small and most of the features will be enabled by installing plugins for the base library with their own dependencies.</p>\n",

With Soletta Project's libraries developers can easily write software for devices that control actuators/sensors (I2C, SPI, UART, GPIO, ADC, PWM and others) and communicate using standard technologies (OIC, CoAP, HTTP, MQTT, LWM2M, Mavlink and others). It enables adding smartness even on the smallest edge devices.</p>\n<p>Portable and scalable, it abstracts details of hardware and OS, enabling developers to reuse their code and knowledge on different targets. The framework has ports done to the following targets:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Linux</li>\n<li>Zephyr OS</li>\n<li>RIOT OS</li>\n<li>(Partially) Contiki OS</li>\n</ul>\n<p>By writing a Soletta application, it's a matter of parametrising specific OS values, like GPIO pin numbers and such (Soletta already eases that task) and, with a makefile that builds with the respective toolchains/SDKs, the same application would be functional for all supported targets.</p>\n<p>One of the ways Soletta exposes of writing applications is by flow-based programming (FBP), which allows the programmer to express business logic as a directional graph of nodes connected to type-specific ports.</p>\n<p>The connected node ports will exchange information packets (IP) that will be used to run the flow. The packet can be either empty, used just to trigger an action, or carry a value such as booleans, integers, floats and even complex data types such as blobs. Ports can decide if the packets they produce will be queued or replaced if they were not consumed by target ports when a new packet is to be produced.</p>\n<p>For those used to traditional object oriented programming (OOP) it's like using the observer pattern on source nodes, calling the associated data getter which is then forwarded to target nodes by calling their setter. However this is done by the core in an efficient and safe way as no memory leaks, type mismatch or invalid memory access can happen.</p>\n<p>Besides that, Soletta exposes all its functionality on a C API, so that FBP is not mandatory.</p>\n",

So far, I have developed a standalone application importing and visualizing the high-resolution large images utilizing PyQt and openslide-python. The interactive front panel is shown in the following Additional Info URL. The image region being visualized is defined by multiple parameters by users.

As the amount of data becomes extreme large, normal computing methods cannot handle such a volume. Running Big Data on Spark ecosystems might be a reasonable way. Its capability to compute data at large scale give us a good solution. However, most of data are unlabeled data; and labeling data not only means highly cost but also requires expertise in that domain.  That is to say, using Supervised Learning algorithms might be unreasonable. In addition, Semi-supervised learning might not be a good way too as for its assumptions need some particular data distributions. Unsupervised Learning (Clustering-based) is a good start step towards this problem. \n       Thus, in this project, I am trying to solve this problem by two phases: retrieving data from Elasticsearch-Hadoop; building a statistical analysis tool on Spark streaming computing from a clustering perspective.  It aims to detecting the patterns in a dataset which behave abnormally.</p>\n",

Then for returning solution, <code>Set</code> are the simplest and most intuitive way. Like in real pen-paper exam, we are supposed to return solutions in form of sets.

The <code>solveset</code> module is based on a <code>Set</code> based results while the <code>solve</code> uses a <code>list</code> for the same. Recently, there has been a lot of development around the <code>solveset</code> to replace <code>solve</code>. The major issues with merging <code>solveset</code> with <code>solve</code> are that the lack of solvers for univariate Transcendental Equations and Multivariate equations.

To address this issue, PowerUp uses Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) to empower middle school girls to take ownership of their health and sexual activity. The proposal is to create a mobile application that will incorporate quality and relevant information surrounding self-esteem and reproductive health, and will offer interactive activities to help concertize corresponding concepts through a choose-your-own-adventure game that puts preadolescent girls in the driver’s seat, making their own decisions to learn about reproductive health and self-esteem.</p>\n",

While many people working together on various functionalities - there are possibilities for anything to break and go undetected for a long time. It might misbehave at times and detecting it would get very difficult at times. Testing a scientific code like TARDIS is crucial - apart from the main code base, the test suite needs to be up-to-date and should have a good code coverage.  This project focuses on development of an extensive test suite - which will stretch and probe many functionalities of TARDIS to make sure everything functions properly. But these test setups are very complex, hence testing is slow and resource extensive.\nSolution - this testing project ! Enabling slow tests to be run at regular intervals on a dedicated server, generating comparison plots and notification of test status through email - these are the assets which are targeted to be added with TARDIS by completion of the project.</p>\n",

In such cases unsupervised learning is a great first step beyond simply picking a random tag or the most frequent form according to some corpus statistics. The way CG is currently combined with the tagger works reasonably well empirically but is actually somewhat unsound in terms of the theory of operation of the tagger (words are identified by different ambiguity classes during training and tagging). For my first task, I will implement new ways of combining them both during in tagging and during tagger training .</p>\n<p>For my second task I will implement an averaged perception POS tagger based on the one in the Python module nltk. This will have some level of configurability in terms of word features (ie can choose to look at suffixes or prefixes of different lengths) to accommodate different types of languages. Another requirement will be to work (not necessarily very well) with little or no configuration (which means eventually not using the coarse tags of the other taggers).</p>\n",

Therefore, malware analysis tools dissect and analyze the behavior of malicious entities at run-time. In this way, security analysts can deduct the cause of infection, e.g., to provide necessary means for potential countermeasures. DRAKVUF is an open source malware analysis framework running on top of the Xen hypervisor. By using Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) techniques, DRAKVUF is able to transparently monitor and control the state of a virtual machine from a level beyond the OS. While DRAKVUF is a powerful means to analyze malware, its use is currently limited to x86-64 based architectures. This project aims to shift the scope of application of DRAKVUF towards ARM and thus the mobile market ultimately providing powerful malware analysis on mobile devices.</p>\n",

While young among programming languages, at just over four years since its public release, it's also rapidly gaining momentum. The community of around fifty thousand users (and growing) have together built nearly eight hundred packages (and counting). Scientists and engineers in particular are excited about Julia's ability to move ideas rapidly from prototype to production, with a flexible and interactive workflow that doesn't compromise on performance. While Julia's dynamic features make it an excellent language for scripting and prototyping in the small, it also provides a host of modern and advanced language features designed for architecting in the large. Language constructs like generic functions and a runtime extensible type system allow users to write generic code not limited to specific data types. Other features like first-class macros and generated functions for staged programming allow further code reuse through metaprogramming.</p>\n<p>Julia's package library is small and still coming of age – but for you, that's a great thing! Joining us for Google Summer of Code is a great opportunity to not only build the packages and features you've always wanted and learn about something new, but also for those contributions to become core parts of Julia's ecosystem and used by many thousands of people. The scope of possible work is endless, but could include areas as diverse as developing the web stack, improving data munging facilities, hacking the compiler, or building packages for areas as life sciences, finance, physics, data science, machine learning, or something completely different! If that sounds interesting to you, please do send an application, or reach out to us at julia-users@googlegroups.com with any questions.</p>\n",

Julia programs are executed by a virtual machine that translates the source code, during run-time, to machine code based on the LLVM compiler framework. LLVM provides a variety of analyses and transformation capabilities that are leveraged to optimize programs and facilitate efficient execution. More recently, LLVM was enhanced by a new optimization framework, namely Polly, that supports automatic parallelization and data-locality optimizations based on the polyhedral model. Polly is able to speed up compute kernels significantly, especially in the context of dense linear algebra and iterative stencil computations. In the course of this project I plan to integrate Polly into Julia to enable polyhedral optimizations for Julia programs.</p>\n",

While many solvers are currently found in ODE.jl, there are still many which are awaiting a native Julia implementation in the package. In particular, there is a lack of implicit solvers implemented in ODE.jl (currently, there is only one implicit solver: ode23s). Such solvers are important because they are especially suited for solving stiff ODEs, which are very common. In light of this, the first goal of my proposed project is a native implementation of implicit solvers RADAU and MEBDFI. Further, in order to reliably use ODE.jl, a robust initial value problem (IVP) testing suite for ODE.jl solvers is a necessity. Work has has been started towards this end through the development of IVPTestSuite.jl. Though, there are many improvements to IVPTestSuite.jl which could be made, especially in improving the ODE solver performance tracking. Thus, the second goal of my proposed project is to advance IVPTestSuite.jl and its surrounding documentation.</p>\n",

On practice software verification tools cannot analyze modules of device drivers with the whole Linux kernel source code. Thus verification of separate modules requires generation of a precise and complete environment model to achieve a suitable false positive rate. I propose to develop a set of specifications for an environment model generator of the LDV Tools system developed in terms of the Linux Driver Verification program. It will help to drastically improve verification results reducing the false positive rate and thus will make it possible to find even more real bugs in the latest versions of the Linux kernel.</p>\n",

Despite its name, LLVM has little to do with traditional virtual machines, though it does provide helpful libraries that can be used to build them.</p>\n<p>LLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research. Code in the LLVM project is licensed under the \"UIUC\" BSD-Style license.</p>\n<p>Among the sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs (as well as some less common ones!) These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>The polly project implements a suite of cache-locality optimizations as well as auto-parallelism and vectorization using a polyhedral model.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>And many others!</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.</p>\n",

The most common reason for the bugs is the semantic merging of C++ entities. Currently, the method for ensuring no regressions is a buildbot for libc++, which builds llvm in modules self-hosted mode. Its main purpose is to find bugs in clang’s implementation and ensure no regression for the ongoing development.</p>\n<p>Since the Module Systems is meant to be generic, the project aims to improve the stability and coverage of the Module System by finding as many issues as possible. One approach is to add a buildbot for libstdc++, because this would change the merging model for the modules, and in this way, it will point out different issues which would not be observed by using libc++. The choice for libstdc++ is motivated by its wider use in Unix and, more importantly, the benefits it will bring to supporting modules for third party projects that rely on libstdc++.</p>\n",

Many of those ideas are applicable to solving some of today's problems we face when writing parallel applications for modern multi-core machines. For this reason we center our effort around HPX (High Performance ParalleX), a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale, which implements many of those ideas.</p>\n<p>The goal for HPX is to create a high quality, freely available, open source implementation of the ParalleX model for conventional systems, such as classic Linux based Beowulf clusters or multi-socket highly parallel SMP nodes. At the same time, we want to have a very modular and well designed runtime system architecture which would allow us to port our implementation onto new computer system architectures. We use real world applications to drive the development of the runtime system, coining out required functionalities and converging onto an stable API which will provide a smooth migration path for developers. The API exposed by HPX is modeled after the interfaces defined by the C++ ISO standard and adheres to the programming guidelines used by the Boost collection of C++ libraries.</p>\n<p>HPX has an active development team that has increased non-stop since 2007 (ref: <a href=\"http://www.openhub.net/p/stellar-hpx\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.openhub.net/p/stellar-hpx</a>) thanks to a modular design that enables features to be added easily.</p>\n",

That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.</p>\n<h3>Simplify complex log data</h3>\n<p>Even if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's patterndb allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.</p>\n<h3>Databases destinations</h3>\n<p>If you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL, even Oracle!), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis, if that's what you are after.</p>\n<h3>Message queue support</h3>\n<p>syslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.</p>\n<h3>Support language bindings</h3>\n<p>Want to deliver log messages to new system, that is not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by few lines of Python code implementing new destination. Not only destinations could be implement, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Rust and Java.</p>\n",

It should be possible to use a GUI or CLI (I will implement both) in Tails to automatically install a service and set everything up so it is reachable as an onion service. It should be a generic solution which makes it easy to add many different services (web server, Etherpad, Mumble server, file sharing service, etc.), but I don't plan to add many of them during this project, because that might go beyond scope. I will instead use a simple web server serving a static page as a first service.</p>\n<p>The user should be able to choose:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>whether s/he wants to require client authentication (using HiddenServiceAuthorizeClient).</li>\n<li>whether the server's configuration and data and the onion service's keys and address are stored persistently (i.e. being restored after reboot) or not.</li>\n<li>whether the service is supposed to automatically start after booting Tails.</li>\n<li>whether it should allow LAN connections.</li>\n</ul>\n",

The Tor community is fully aware of the problem and the Tor browser has been modified to follow the \"one fingerprint for all\" approach. However, due to the constant evolution of the web and its underlying technologies, it has become a true challenge to always stay ahead of the latest fingerprinting techniques.</p>\n<p>For this Google Summer of Code project, I propose to develop the Fingerprint Central website that will run a fingerprinting test suite and collect data from Tor browsers to help developers design and test new defences against browser fingerprinting. The website will be similar to AmIUnique.org or Panopticlick for users where they will get a complete summary with statistics after the test suite has been executed. It can be used to test new fingerprinting protection as well as making sure that fingerprinting-related bugs were correctly fixed with specific regression tests. The expected long-term impact of this project is to reduce the differences between Tor users and reinforce their privacy and anonymity online.</p>\n",

Unitex/GramLab is a platform in which you can put linguistic resources, manage them and use them. It is open source, cross-platform, modular, and allows you to deal with languages that use special writing systems (e.g. Arabic and many Asian languages). Some of its functional features stem from its resources: precision, completeness, and ability to handle multi-word units, including through the use of dictionaries and local grammars.</p>\n<p>The dictionaries specify the simple and multi-word units of a language together with their lemmas and a set of grammatical (semantic and inflectional) codes. The availability of these dictionaries is a major advantage compared to the usual utilities for pattern searching: the information they contain can be used for searching and matching, thus describing large classes of words using very simple patterns. The dictionaries are presented in a specific formalism called <a href=\"http://unitexgramlab.org/index.php?page=7\" target=\"_blank\">DELA</a>, internally compiled into a minimal finite state automata, and were constructed by teams of linguists from different countries for several languages: French, English, Greek, Italian, Spanish, German, Arabic, Thai, Korean, Polish, Norwegian, Portuguese.</p>\n<p>The grammars are representations of linguistic phenomena on the basis of recursive transition networks (RTN), a formalism closely related to FST. Numerous studies have shown the adequacy of automata for linguistic problems at all descriptive levels from morphology and syntax to phonetic issues. Grammars created with Unitex/GramLab carry this approach further by using a formalism even more powerful than automata. They are represented as graphs that the user can easily create and update using a visual integrated development environment which is an essential part of the platform.</p>\n",

TreeCloud reflects frequencies of the words with the color and font size and semantic proximity of the words with the length of the branches. Such tool is a highly demonstrative way to overlook and analyse the text in its lexical and pragmatical aspects. It is of a great thing to integrate such tool into Unitex/GramLab. The present project aims to make this feature possible for Unitex users. CloudTree will be built for occurences of words in Unitex concordance output. Such visualization will be useful in characterising the context of the search token and can be applied in semantic, lexical, typological, or disourse analysis.</p>\n",

Videos that are out of sync are often uncomfortable to watch to a viewer, so it is mandatory that any reasonable video editing software should contain some audio/video sync mechanisms, otherwise the software may not be used because the users would quickly become discouraged. Currently VLMC lacks any reasonable strategy for synching streams from multiple video sources. This often leads to final video being out of sync if its composed of material from multiple sources. The goal of this proposal is to introduce a solution to this problem - an abstract clock mechanism, that would feed renderers with data at just the right time.</p>\n",

This includes traditional keyword queries but also query-by-example, query-by-sketch, and motion queries that rely on intrinsic vide features features such as, for instance, color, edge or motion information. At the user interface, sample images or sample videos (query-by-example), hand-drawn sketches (query-by-sketch) or flow fields (motion queries) and combinations thereof can be used. The system is composed of the flexible retrieval engine Cineast, and the storage back-end ADAM.</p>\n<p>At the moment vitrivr supports searching using color, edges and motion. However, thanks to its flexible architecture, it is able to support many more retrieval modes. This is what we want to explore further in GSoC.</p>\n<h3>What is Cineast?</h3>\n<p>Cineast is a content-based video retrieval engine which retrieves video sequences based on their visual content. It supports Query-by-Example as well as Query-by-Sketch by using a multitude of low-level visual features in parallel.</p>\n<h3>What is ADAM?</h3>\n<p>ADAM is a database system to store and retrieve multimedia data. It provides Boolean retrieval and similarity search and makes use of a various index structures for efficient retrieval.</p>\n",

IFTTT technology being one of the most popular ways of making chains of web services communicate with one another, will be used to make Wikidata to communicate with other web services (IFTTT web service)  across the web. This project involves studying the Wikidata API, IFTTT technology internals and providing a new and friendly way to communicate to Wikidata. Adding RSS views will enable users to connect with the service independent of IFTTT and writing tests will automate testing of the application saving time and improving on productivity.</p>\n",
