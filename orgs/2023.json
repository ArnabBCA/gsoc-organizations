To achieve this objective, the project architecture involves the development of a Flutter App and a NodeJs + Express Server, both powered by the Appwrite backend. By integrating Appwrite, the platform will benefit from its robust features and functionalities, replacing the previously planned Firebase backend. \n\nThe Flutter App will serve as the primary user interface, offering a seamless and intuitive experience for users. The Node.js + Express Server will handle the backend logic, providing essential APIs for communication with the Appwrite backend. This integration will enable efficient management of rooms/spaces and storage of user-generated content.\n\nAdditionally, the project will leverage Livekit, an open-source WebRTC Stack, to provide real-time audio communication infrastructure. By incorporating Livekit into the platform, users will have the means to engage in live discussions, enabling effective collaboration and fostering a sense of community.",

          "abstract_html": "Online learning has taken the front seat in the post pandemic age. With the advent of sophisticated AI architectures like the Transformers, it is but natural that AI would find its way into education. Learning online via YouTube or MOOC platforms is often done as a method of self learning. The biggest obstacle faced by a student in self learning is the lack of attention span. An online tool that can generate short quizzes on input educational content can be of great use to teachers and students alike as it can help retain important information, frame questions and quickly revise large chunks of content. \nEduAid is one such project where I propose the usage of open source and lightweight Large Language Models for quiz generation. The language modelling capabilities of LLMs can be leveraged for achieving this task. Finally, we develop a chrome extension that allows end users to interact with the pipeline and generate quizzes based on input text.",

Agent is the core of this distributed system which does the heavy lifting of transfer jobs. Right now, agents have to be manually deploy and configure to start the transfer. This is a problem for researchers and people who need to transfer data without having much technical skills or time.\n\nUpdated Proposal Summary:\nUpdated proposal includes creating a desktop application and cybershuttle server to orchestrate the lifecycle management. This will guide cybershuttle agent and MFT agent from cybershuttle server to perform execution of jobs and data transfer, this would also maintain the lifecycle of cybershuttle agent and mft agents. This would help deploy any software and not limited to MFT agents.\n\nThe proposed solution is to automate the process of deploying and lifecycle management of the agents when a transfer job is submitted from an edge machine. This will help various researchers and people who needs to transfer data from a source to a destination without having much technical skills or time.\n\nThe deliverables are a piece of code to deploy the agent on various virtual machines, a piece of code to maintain the agent's lifecycle, an automated process for deployment and management, onboarding users and evaluating edge cases, and automated agent placement.\n\nThe benefits of the proposed solution are that it will make it easy and on the go solution for people even with less technical ability to use the vast speeds and advantages MFT offers. It will save time and effort for researchers and people who need to transfer data from a source to destination. It will make the MFT more user-friendly and accessible to a wider range of people. It not just stops at MFT, in fact users can deploy any containerizable applications using this solution.",

The goal is to create a reference guide that others can use to build ML pipelines for image processing or computer vision problems. I already have experience working with image processing to detect breast cancer cells in histopathological images and want to leverage that to build a similar pipeline using Apache Beam for image processing use cases. This can also be expanded to other computer vision problems like object detection, facial recognition, optical character recognition, and hand gesture recognition for disabled people.\n\nFollowing are some ideas on notebooks that I can build and contribute to :\n\n1. Image Data Preprocessing: Apache Beam can be used to create a pipeline for different image pre-processing tasks like resizing, cropping, normalizing and filtering for different image file formats like TIFF, PNG and converting it into a more standardized format like JSON.\n\n2. Model Inference: We can showcase how trained models can be used to make real time inferences in a Beam pipeline.\n\n3. Model Evaluation: We can evaluate the model using Apache Beam, utilizing various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n4. Stretch Goal: If time permits, we can do a similar process for video datasets and show how to preprocess videos using Beam.\n\nDeliverables \n\nApache Beam notebook with working code to deploy a pipeline for image processing/video processing use case and supporting documentation.",

My proposal consists of two major improvements, one for metrics and another for tracing. For metrics, the proposed improvements include adding metric instrumentation for the consumer side of RPC calls, as well as for the registry, configuration, metadata centers, and RPC exception handling. For tracing, the proposed improvements include enhancing the configuration loading and component initialization for tracing, adding support for the B3 standard, aligning the configuration with Dubbo-java, and adding support for other observability backends.

We will try to achieve this by developing a tool that automatically finds and tracks first (or 3rd, or 10th) pull requests in a specified repository on Github that belongs to a specific community. The idea is that the PMC can take this data and send “Thank you” notes or emails to new people that joined the community and made their first contribution. If these automatic reports show that there are contributors with consistent commits to the project, PMC can send them encouragement emails to keep up the good work and become committers, etc. \nProject Description \nThe tool will be based on using Github API to retrieve a list of all pull requests in the specified repository. Users will be able to set search parameters such as repository name and filters by pull request status.\nUsers can use this tool to:\nTrack pull requests in their own repositories \nTrack issues opened in their own repositories\nTrack the activity of individual contributors to encourage them to improve\nThe tool will provide a user-friendly interface for searching and filtering valuable community information, such as pull requests, issues, questions in StackOverflow and others. Users will also be able to configure notifications to receive alerts about new pull requests.\nTechnical Details\nThe tool will be developed in Python and will use the Github API directly to fetch data (another possibility is using the  PyGithub library to interact with Github API, however this may not be necessary). For the user interface, we can use the Flask or Django framework. The tool will be deployed on a web server and will be accessible through a browser.",

The standard formal verifier can be adopted (e.g., Prusti, Creusot) to formally verify the function's behavior.\n\nA set of deliverables as follows can be anticipated in the coming future.\n\nMilestones: Basic policies (e.g., addition, subtraction) of the data can be verified by Teaclave; Complex policies can be verified.\n\nComponents: Verifier for the function code; Policy language adapters (adapt policy language to verifier); Policy language parser; Function source code converter (append policies to the functions).\n\nDocumentation: The internal working mechanism of the verification; How to write policies for the data.",

Ardupilot is used in various applications, including swarming. Improving the existing avoidance libraries to avoid vehicles in the vicinity of a vehicle would be a great enhancement to the software. This would reduce the number of in-air accidents during swarming and lead to safer flights. This project aims to enable a vehicle to gather information about the vehicles near it using various sources like mavlink multicast, absb, droneid, etc., and feed the data into the avoidance libraries to avoid them.",

One such SoC is TDA4VM, with heterogeneous multicore support it can run multiple operating systems simultaneously. TDA4VM has Dual 64-bit Arm® Cortex®-A72 microprocessor subsystem at up to 2.0 GHz, Six Arm® Cortex®-R5F MCUs at up to 1.0 GHz, Two C66x floating point DSP, up to 1.35 GHz, 40 GFLOPS, 160 GOPS and 3D GPU PowerVR® Rogue 8XE GE8430, up to 750 MHz, 96 GFLOPS, 6 Gpix/sec.\nZephyr is a small real-time operating system for connected, resource-constrained and embedded devices supporting multiple architectures. Zephyr allows for easy handling of multiple configuration options, APIs and external components, and is well suited to structured application development. Another benefit of Zephyr is that it targets some very serious protocol and standard implementations, being e.g. the first open source RTOS to introduce TSN support – by way of Antmicro’s contribution. The rising popularity of TSN in automotive and aerospace applications, and just about everywhere else, could be a very important reason to start using Zephyr in your TSN-capable product.\nThe goal of the project is to add Zephyr RTOS support to run on Cortex R5 processor core loaded from A72 core running Linux through remoteproc and add few peripheral support (Interrupts, Gpio, UART, Timers) for TDA4VM. The Cortex R5 processor cores are built to provide deeply embedded real-time and safety-critical systems. Adding Zephyr RTOS support for R5 cores in TDA4VM will be very helpful for the Users..\nProgramming Languages: Assembly Programming, C.",

This project intends to further bridge the IfcOpenShell and BrickSchema open-source communities and shared mission to evolve the common exchange of building information. By upgrading the bare-bones BrickSchema module in IfcOpenShell’s Blender addon, BlenderBIM, this project will allow users to seamlessly edit Brick entities and relationships. Features include entity editing, feed relationship editing, undo/redo support, and save-to-file utilities. This is particularly important to the continued management phase of a building’s life cycle, so this project will contribute to BlenderBIM’s coverage over building lifetimes. Furthermore, although the IFC and Brick schemas exist separately, there is continued industry interest in utilizing IFC to enhance the granularity of BrickSchema—the project aims to contribute to this endeavor.",

The viewer backend (OpenSlide) didn't support DICOM, so we needed a second backend. Surprisingly, before the coding period started, OpenSlide did get DICOM file support and this gave me the opportunity to tackle the bigger challenge of integrating BioFormats into caMicroscope. This would be extraordinary, as BioFormats is a Java library with no C wrappers available online.\n\nI started by refactoring caMicroscope code to use a single base Dockerfile which compiled OpenSlide. Then I made a Java wrapper and prepared its corresponding C caller. For this, I had chosen GraalVM C API, but once I found out about its level of performance and its requirement to achieve high code covergage first (for metadata collection), I rewrote it for Java JNI. To make it available to the two derivatives of our base image, I refactored this to be a separate project. We also needed to make this available to our Python image metadata server, so I wrote a wrapper in Python using cffi.",

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\nThe public instance of cBioPortal (https://cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 4,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012 & Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013 have been cited more than 5,600 and 5,100 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe.\n\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands.",

Currently, new data sets can be uploaded to a separate repository for further review. However, to ensure full quality assurance, new data sets must be manually imported into an instance of cBioPortal and visually inspected to ensure the data displays correctly. This manual step is tedious, and presents a barrier to easily reviewing new submissions. \n\nTo resolve this bottleneck in the review process, the proposed solution will create a new workflow that will trigger upon a new submission to automatically deploy a live staging instance of cBioPortal, with the new data set already imported. Time permitting, a second potential workflow could also be explored to further streamline the process by generating resources such as screenshots for easier visual inspection. These improvements would allow cBioPortal maintainers to more easily validate new submissions, leading to faster approvals for new data, and a higher quality database for cancer researchers.",

It is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it.\n\nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.\n\nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.\n\nIn addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: support, AI, rclone, cloud, flutter, peer-to-peer and a few more that are starting to take shape.\n\nThe best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics & technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.\n\nWe’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 9th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment. If you want to be a part of such community and help achieve our goals, come join our Slack group or mailing list!",

Besides these, the clock will also include unique features to dismiss the alarm such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple math problems of varying difficulty or shaking the phone. This is an open-source, free, and ad-free project that's built with Flutter.\n\nProposed Deliverables\n\n- A Flutter application that runs as a foreground service and uses Firestore as its database which would hold all the alarms created by the user.\n- This app would allow users to set conditional alarms by tracking their phone activity, location, weather or shared settings.\n- It would also enable users to set up unique challenges such as scanning a QR/Bar code, solving simple mathematical questions of varying difficulty or shaking the phone to dismiss the alarm.\n- Set up end-to-end testing using GitHub Actions to ensure that the application does not break in Android or iOS.\n\nAdditionally, if time permits, I'd also like to work on the following features:\n\n- Implementing some other features such as showing the weather forecast or motivational quotes on the dismissed screen. \n- Making an option to allow users to set quick alarms (alarms relative to the current time, say 10 minutes from now) with intervals (say 6 alarms at an interval of 10 minutes between 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM)\n\nPlan of Implementation\n\nTo implement the core functionalities, I will set up the application as a foreground service which will ensure that the alarms set will persist through reboots.\n\nThe unique features such as conditional alarms or dismissal challenges can be implemented using open source packages such as weather, location, and so on.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

There is mostly work on the front end to be done here designing the\npossible options in the settings to display this metric.

          "abstract_html": "Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown great potential in solving the complex problem of charged particle tracking, which is an essential task in high-energy physics. Charged particle tracking entails reconstructing the trajectory of charged particles produced after particle collisions, and the scalability of GNNs could enable this task to be performed with high efficiency. The first step in applying GNNs to particle detector data is to construct edges between hits, which then enables a GNN to operate on the graph and generate predicted trajectories. The current process for graph construction involves constructing all possible edges first and then removing edges that violate manually set geometric constraints. This project aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of this graph construction step by creating a point cloud network (PCN) with PyTorch Geometric to perform this task. PCNs are a recently developed class of neural networks that operate directly on point cloud data, and they could be used to perform graph construction without manually selected geometric constraints and with fewer edge constructions in total. This project also involves optimizing hyperparameters for the PCN model architecture and the training process by using Ray tune and Optuna.",

The application renders a detector that detects the collisions of particles that have been accelerated up to speeds comparable to that of light, along with the event data that consists of tracks, jets, missing energy, etc. after the collision.\n\nThe problem statement is to improve the visualization of the event, for example, by developing a customizable and interactive cartesian grid functionality, so as to better give the idea of the locations and distances of the particles to the researchers. Also, the user should be able to view the dimensions of the individual detector parts. Apart from this, the users should be able to navigate to the individual detector parts. My plan for the first problem is to introduce a 3D cartesian grid with multiple equally spaced XY, YZ, and ZX planes, as well as, to be able to display the 3D coordinates of a point on clicking. For this, I will make use of the ThreeJS raycaster intersects. Also, I am planning to render the Euclidean distance between any two points clicked. To view the dimensions of the detector, I am planning to render the dimensions of the bounding box of the component. The solution for the second problem would be to list the detector parts and let the user select any one of them, after which it will be highlighted using a ThreeJS outline pass.",

Currently, the way a notebook kernel connects to a Spark cluster is through SWAN’s own open-source SparkConnector extension. Due to a current Spark limitation, it is not possible for multiple notebooks to share the same set of Spark resources. In addition, the process of spawning the Spark resources could take a while, and may add an inconvenience.\n\nCurrently, an effort is underway to employ a client-server architecture known as Spark Connect. This would allow multiple notebooks to connect to a previously instantiated Spark session and submit computations to it.\n\nTo make allocating Spark resources easier for users, this project proposes the development of a JupyterLab extension. The extension shall have a friendly interface that would allow users to instantiate one or more Spark sessions–in which the notebook will be able to connect, configure proper credentials and authentication, and make the connection accessible to the notebook code. The connection and session will be persistent across multiple kernels and restarts.",

These scripts will then provide users an easy way to deploy their deep learning models in their physics software and analysis frameworks.\r\n\r\nThis project will focus on development of some missing deep learning operations which will allow to build more complex networks within TMVA for parsing the Transformer based models and Graph Net Models in SOFIE. Specifically, we propose to implement the inference functionality of some ONNX operators in the code generation format. The student can choose to build this based on existing implementations in TMVA or other existing machine learning software tools or build their own from scratch. The expected result is a working implementation of modular operators classes that implement the operators as defined by the ONNX standards in the code generation format.

Additionally, I aim to explore the impact of different computing architectures and job submission systems on energy efficiency. To achieve these goals, I will use metrics from the Green Software Foundation and other resources to estimate energy efficiency. I will then evaluate whether to make small changes to the code to improve efficiency and evaluate the potential savings. I will also test the software on different platforms and job submission systems. My expected results include a summary of metrics for software energy consumption, visualisation of test results, and identification of possible improvements to software algorithms.

Since Numba compiles the code in loops into machine code it only has to cross the language barrier once and the loops thus run faster.\nInitial support for Cppyy objects in Numba enabled the use of builtin types and classes, but some essential C++ features, such as references and STL classes, are not yet supported.\n\n\nThe project aims to add support for C++ reference types in Numba through Cppyy and improve the existing numba extension implementation to provide general support for C++ templates.

          "abstract_html": "Polygons are defined by one outer ring and possibly multiple inner rings representing holes, where each ring is usually represented as a sequence of points. This allows for several undesirable configurations, such as self-intersecting rings, badly nested rings (inner outside outer), and inner rings that split the interior of the polygon into multiple disjoint parts. Such undesirable configurations are considered as invalid polygons in many applications, such as in Geographic Information Systems through ISO 19107.\n\nThe aim of this project is to incorporate the polygon repair method originally described in https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2014.01.009 (but later improved) as a CGAL package. This method consists of three steps: (1) a constrained triangulation of the polygon, (2) labelling of its faces as interior/exterior, (3) extraction of the resulting polygon(s) from the sets of labelled triangular faces.\n\nThe method is already implemented using CGAL and freely available as prepair: https://github.com/tudelft3d/prepair. Integrating it with CGAL as a new package would likely involve switching the code's GDAL dependency with new functions for native CGAL types, adding some functionality in the CGAL 2D/3D Triangulations package (proper deletion of constraints), and the writing of CGAL-style templated code (with support for different kernels and so on).",

The planned extension with the adaptive remeshing involves expanding the edge splitting and collapsing rules, and introducing a new formulation of the tangential relaxation; in addition, feature edges must be addressed.

Support for DSP48E within the F4PGA architecture definitions. 2. Testing flow for designs using Xilinx 7-series DSP hard blocks which include Verilog-to-Bitstream using the F4PGA toolchain, Fasm2bels to re-generate the original netlist from the bitstream output of F4PGA and Proof-test through Vivado to verify the correctness of the netlist.",

Sometimes, even typing a simple word can cause a slowdown on certain websites, resulting in a less-than-joyful user experience.\n\n\n\nTo tackle this issue, our project is here to fine-tune the way keyboard events are tracked, allowing for a closer eye on a broader range of these keyboard events, including the basics like keypress and composition events. This means developers can get a better grasp on how websites respond to keyboard inputs, making improvements where necessary and enhancing crucial metrics such as the Interaction to Next Paint (INP).",

A three-step evaluation procedure has been proposed, and the onboarding automation scripts and the HMR lifecycle have been implemented.

WebAssembly is especially popular for web games and other performance-oriented applications. As of March 2023, Emscripten uses an emulated file system written in JavaScript to support C/C++ file system operations in compiled WebAssembly code. Currently, the mentors are working on WasmFS, an emulated file system built in C++/WebAssembly, for Emscripten. However, WasmFS lacks the JavaScript required to connect the existing JS API to the new C++/WebAssembly file system operations. \r\n\r\nThe central goal of this project is to build a new JavaScript library modeled after Emscripten’s existing file system library that will call WasmFS functions instead of JavaScript routines. This approach aims to speed up filesystem operations and lay the foundation to add multithreading in the future. That being said, this project does not aim to redesign the filesystem implementation for Emscripten. This project also will not add new functionality to the Emscripten file system. Finally, this project will not attempt to add full multithreading functionality yet.",

Having robust tests prevents making code-breaking changes to the codebase. This task will include adding unit tests for the API suite, prediction upload evaluation workers, code upload evaluation workers (on EKS), and integration tests for end-to-end testing of all components.",

The addition of time frames for metrics would provide developers with a lot of flexibility when analyzing their application’s performance as they would be able to easily switch between different timeframes to get a better understanding of how their application is performing. This can be achieved by modifying the structure of the Metric CRD by adding certain fields and then modifying the APIs of our Metric providers to support these newly added fields.

The solution this proposal provides is that in order to create a plugin for kubectl we need the help of armadactl i.e. command-line utility for Armada through which users submit their jobs to the Armada server. To develop a plugin for kubectl, we first must develop a base plugin for armadactl in Go that performs basic tasks such as submission and cancellation of jobs, creation of queues, etc. After the necessary coding for the plugin is finished, we now distribute that plugin over at Krew so that it is globally accessible. Once it is distributed at Krew, a user can install this plugin as a kubectl plugin and can interact with the Armada server and perform the aforementioned tasks.",

There are millions of devices running coreboot, including Google Chromebooks and Chromeboxes, and it runs in many datacenters. In 2021, coreboot.org had over 300 active developers, and over 6000 commits.\nThe coreboot project believes in the principles of Open Source software. It borrows many well known concepts from other Open Source projects: Kconfig, Linux kernel coding style, git repository, and Gerrit for code reviews.\ncoreboot has numerous advantages over other firmware projects. It comes with SoC support available to all developers. The codebase is shared with developers and companies which are helping to improve the SoC and driver-specific implementations.\n\n** Extremely fast **\n- coreboot is designed to do the minimum amount necessary and get out of the way.\n- Desktop and Notebooks boot up in 400ms - 2.5s.\n- Server boot time can be as low as a quarter of the OEM BIOS boot time.\n\n\n** Flexible and customizable **\n- Because coreboot only does hardware init, then jumps to a payload to continue, it is very flexible.\n- GPLv2 licensed core. Payloads can be proprietary and we offer a BSD licensed support library. coreboot provides ready-to-build payloads like UEFI, SeaBIOS, U-Boot, Grub2 and many more.\n- Recovery Mode based on multiple copies of the firmware which can be updated independently.\n- Integrity of stages and binaries in coreboot can be easily verified.\n- Designed for security by default.\n- Uses a minimal trusted computing base for each platform which is easily auditable, helping to guarantee security. As coreboot is Open Source, anyone can check the codebase.\n\n** Debugging **\n- There are multiple ways to extract the boot log, from classic serial to EHCI debug, even over the pc-speaker.\n- GDB Stub support via serial.\n- In memory console log support.\n- Tracing functions and other exotic features are supported.",

Among the three major approaches to this task, i.e., classification, ranking, and translation [Chakraborty et.al, 2019], this proposal will primarily focus on the latter one (translation). The key motivation behind choosing the translation approach  is the significant performance improvement observed with the use of pre-trained language models such as T5 or GPT models in translation tasks.",

However, it was found that only few of these articles had some other predicate relationship with the Berlin_Wall article. Currently, such relationships are extracted from tables and the info boxes. In this project, we aim to make use of the unstructured text on the Wikipedia page to find relations among entities. The goal of this project is to develop a framework for predicate resolution of wiki links among entities. I will be using some recent research work on relation extraction to achieve this.",

This project would achieve the goal by 1) Work with the current codebase to refine and refactor, followed by deployment and a CI/CD pipeline using Docker and GitHub Actions. 2) Introduce new features to the chatbot by adding scenarios that adds explainability on Qanary pipeline and its components. 3) Evaluation of the DBpedia chatbot by running A/B tests to measure user satisfaction 4) Machine Learning integrations might be used to create recommendations for improved QA pipeline configurations.",

The SANTE search API is an important component of DBpedia that enables users to search and retrieve information from the knowledge graph using natural language queries. However, like any search engine, the performance of the API can be improved by optimising the underlying technology, data quality, and user experience. Therefore, this project will focus on enhancing the search API by incorporating various techniques such as data quality improvement, indexing optimisation, query parsing enhancement, incorporation of external knowledge sources, relevance feedback, and the use of machine learning techniques. These enhancements will improve the accuracy, efficiency, and usability of the SANTE search API, making it a more valuable tool for knowledge discovery and information retrieval.\n\nThere are several knowledge bases currently published in RDF format and exploring this information is still challenging for non-RDF neither SPARQL users.\nDBpedia-Search aims at facilitating information navigation, exploration, and seeking through DBpedia Knowledge base with natural language queries.\nThis GSoC project consists of enhancing DBpedia Search APIs by including tests, benchmarks, and additional functionalities.",

We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC contributors have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (>1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.",

Eclipse 4diac has, in recent years, advanced in terms of providing tool support for domain experts. The control software is typically executed in real-time and distributed across devices. Designing such systems is complex due to the need for communication between devices. To detect faults early, modeling implicit assumptions within IEC 61499 software can provide the basis for automated checks. Such assumptions are typically described in constraint languages, which are difficult to use by automation experts. Therefore, this project provides the infrastructure for tool-assisted communication engineering. Where user interactions are required, graphical visualizations are provided. Current infrastructure for generating automated communication does not support the variety of communication protocols that is observed in modern automation systems.",

One of the current challenges the project faces is that it is running on outdated versions of Jakarta EE and Payara. Upgrading to newer versions will bring numerous benefits, such as improved performance, better security, and access to new features. In this project, I propose to upgrade the Eclipse Cargo Tracker application to Jakarta EE 10 and Payara 6. This will involve updating the project's dependencies, making necessary changes to the codebase, and ensuring that the application remains compatible with these newer versions. Additionally, the project's documentation will also need to be updated to reflect these changes.",

Currently, the project relies purely on static analysis of code structures to identify patterns. This project extends capa to work on dynamic execution data such as sandbox run traces or code emulation analysis.\n\nThe introduction of dynamic analysis to capa is set to make analyzing samples that feature anti-analysis techniques a much easier task. This is an issue of concern since a large number of distributed software nowadays gets packed with commercial or private packers, which means that capa would fail to profile these executables' capabilities successfully. However, this can be circumvented by introducing dynamic analysis to the problem, which it would enable capa to get a view of the program after it had been unpacked in memory, thereby making it possible to extract the capabilities from the executable at hand.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Add support for the future integration of several sandbox solutions by means of an associated feature extractor.\n2. Implement a feature extractor for the Cuckoo-based CAPE Malware Configuration and Payload Extractor.\n3. Introduce capa features that are specific to dynamic analysis (such as captured network traffic).\n4. Add dynamic-based support for function call arguments.\n5. Write novel rules that make use of the newly introduced dynamic capability extraction.",

We will research language string embeddings and create extractor code, leveraging existing knowledge and code to bootstrap this. The project will identify strings related to runtime and library code for targeted programming languages and extend standard output format to render the results. The successful completion of this project will make FLOSS more useful for security analysts and manifest its success as the default tool used for malware analysis.",

Each rule is matched against features that CAPA extracts from a program. Extracted features include file-level features such as strings, section names, imports, and exports and function-level features such as API calls, string and byte references, instruction mnemonics, and number constants.\n\nCAPA uses feature extractors, called \"backends\", to extract features from supported file types (PE, ELF, and .NET) and architectures (32- and 64-bit x86). Each backend is built around an existing tool or library that provides file parsing and disassembly capabilities. CAPA uses this to extract features. CAPA currently implements backends using Vivisect, IDA Pro, and dnfile.\n\nGhidra is a popular open-source disassembly framework with a robust API to access its analysis. Programs can interact with a wealth of information that includes parsed file formats and disassembled code. The goal of this project is to develop a Ghidra backend for CAPA using Python 3 (via Ghidrathon) and Ghidra’s scripting API. Users should be able to invoke CAPA such that it uses Ghidra’s analysis engine and/or invoke CAPA from within Ghidra.",

Currently, LFortran can compile the majority of Fortran files to ASR (Abstract Semantic Representation); however, there are some lacking features, such as COMMON, BLOCK DATA, SAVE, etc., that must be implemented for it to function properly. I have supplied multiple implementations that will allow these features to function effectively in the vast majority of circumstances. When lacking features are successfully implemented, the majority of the codebase will compile to LLVM. First, I will concentrate on the following packages: specfun, odepack, quadpack, fitpack, and Arpack, and then I will shift to other packages.

In terms of the project, the goal is to work in scripts to draw devices like LDNMOS, LDPMOS, bipolar transistors, photodiodes, Avalanche Diode, etc as well as fixing a few devices that are known to draw incorrectly for some parameter values.as far as working on this project is concerned as per my own rough timeline following is the methodology i would use while working on the project : The magic VLSI tool uses TCL scripts for the parameterized design layouts so we should start by going through some of the scripts to get a better understanding of what we are working with then we will be going through each of the mentioned devices and study its CMOS design and draw it on the magic tool using the magic command line TCL scripts, we will also be looking at the pre-existing devices to check if we were getting the required drawings of them or not if the drawings are not as required then we will be making changes to those scripts as well, in the meantime, we will be looking for improvements we could make on the user inference of magic tool too. \nto get a better understanding of how I would work on this project please go through the proposal I have attached below. \nthankyou soo much for your time, \nlooking forward to working with you soon.",

          "abstract_html": "As the demand for High-Performance Computing (HPC) continues to grow, there is a need for open-source solutions that can deliver the performance required by modern applications. Different open-source architecture frameworks have been developed by the community, like OpenPiton, however, all of them present performance limitations that impact their ability to execute computationally-intensive tasks. \n\nOpenPiton is an open-source framework for designing many-core processors. Although OpenPiton was originally developed for SPARC v9 architectures, currently it is also compatible with different core architectures (RISC-V 32-bit, RISC-V 64-bit, x86, and SPARCv9). In this project, we will focus on improving the performance of the integration of CVA6/Ariane into OpenPiton (OpenPiton+Ariane).\n\nThe architecture of OpenPiton consists of one chipset and one or more tiles. The chipset houses modules used to communicate the tiles with the peripherals, such as the UART. The tile is used to build the mesh for many-core designs. In these designs, the tiles are interconnected by three NoC routers to generate the mesh. Each tile comprises the three NoC routers, the Ariane core, and the cache hierarchy, which consists of Ariane’s private L1 data and instruction caches, a private L1.5 cache and a shared distributed L2 cache. \n\nDespite the fact that OpenPiton offers many advantages, it presents performance limitations that restrict its adoption in the HPC field. In this project, we will improve the performance of OpenPiton by replacing the L1 data cache of Ariane with the High-Performance, Multi-Requester, Out-of-Order, L1 data cache (HPDcache). In addition, other features such as the amount of L1.5 cache miss status holding registers (MSHRs) or the L1.5 cache associativity can also be improved in order to approach OpenPiton even closer to the HPC field.",

This is important as user need to brows through the all the existing models which are the part of the repository and download only selective models. A structured local storage will not only also allow users to easily add their own models to the local library management system, but also to the online repository open to public. For maintaining the metadata of these, a well defined storage structure is required.\nAll this need to have an proper interface to be operable. The interface for the above will be developed as both a Graphical Interface and module for python scripting.",

          "abstract_html": "On-machine Inspection (OMI) is a valuable tool used in CNC commercial manufacturing to ensure proper tolerances of the manufactured piece. This is done by attaching a probe to the tool head of the machine and scanning the surface of the finalised product to see if there are discrepancies between the expected result and actual measurements. \n\nIncluding such a tool on FreeCAD, which already has a dedicated set of tools for CNC milling in the Path Workbench, will not only bring it closer to proprietary solutions but even surpass some of them that don't have this feature. This would save time for the machinist and also increase the inherent accuracy of the whole process.\n\nBuilding upon this, sensing solutions can introduce novel approaches to improve the CAM workflow and even generate new solutions not seen before. This proposal argues for an automatized post-processing of, for example, 3D prints by milling them to correct tolerances and inherent defects of the manufacturing process like layer patterns, over-extrusion or limited resolution. \n\nFor On-machine inspection, there are already commercial solutions available so it's a matter of replicating their implementations on Python for FreeCAD. For the post-processing tool, a more involved overview of optimization algorithms for closely-matching volumes will be needed but it's surely available in the literature. If not, my background in mathematics and physics should prove valuable in the development of such an algorithm.\n\nThus, the main goals for the proposal are to prodive the FreeCAD Path Workbench with two new tools, On-machine Inspection and automatized post-processing of already manufactured pieces, and also to properly test and document these new tools in the FreeCAD wiki.",

          "abstract_html": "It is easy to render fonts well on screens with high pixel density.  However, straightforward algorithms run into problems when rendering with few pixels available.  For example, fonts where the capital “O” is taller than the capital “T”, or vice versa, should have these characters rendered at the same height when few pixels are available to avoid bumpy-looking text.  Many modern font formats  contain “hints” in these cases, which tell the renderer how it should align each symbol in the font to the pixel grid to create the most legible and consistent rendering.  However, not all fonts and font formats contain hints.  In these cases, the auto-hinter can be enabled, which analyzes the shapes in the font to fix some common issues that would normally be fixed by manually added hints.  This project aims to further improve this process by adding corrections for specific letters, such as “i”, where the dot can merge with the stem, and “ñ”, where the tilde can lose its shape and become flat.  These changes would be described in a capabilities database with a format designed as part of the project.",

Hence, resource allocation in wireless transmission plays a vital role in optimizing the throughput of a link.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement a joint power and rate controller in user space using the Rateman Python package. As a rate control algorithm in user space has already been developed at SupraCoNeX, namely \"py_minstrel_ht\", this variant of Minstrel-HT can be extended with power tuning capability to better manage interference and increase spatial reuse. In general, the proposed joint controller will consist of a power tuning module that tweaks the power level of the set of best rates, selected by the Minstrel-HT, to an optimal value. Furthermore, the joint controller could also be extended to support modes such as fixed power and low power.",

This project proposes integration with OpenSUSE's OpenBuildService, which also provides automation and remote compilation.\n\nThe plan currently looks like the following:\n1. Document the existing approaches on automating the build system.\n2. Write a build script that integrates with the obs-build repository.\n3. Get security approval, as documented in https://github.com/openSUSE/obs-build/blob/master/HOWTO.add_another_format.\n4.

          "abstract_html": "LuCI is a framework used to build web interfaces for configuration and monitoring on embedded devices such as WiFi routers, etc. In the old CBI based system, pages were rendered on the router and delivered as HTML to the browser, leading to a higher load on the embedded devices. To address this issue, LuCI applications must be migrated to JavaScript-based framework to reduce the load on embedded devices and improve performance. This migration involves rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router. To facilitate this migration, LuCI provides a JavaScript API that will be used to build web interfaces that can be rendered in the browser. To make this migration possible, new RPCD services will be developed to provide data to the client side that was formerly used directly on the router. This data will be provided in JSON format via RPCD (Remote Procedure Call Daemon) and UBUS. These new RPCD services will need to provide the same functionality as the old system but in a format that can be used by client-side JavaScript.\nThe migration of LuCI to JavaScript-based framework will offer several benefits to OpenWrt community and other users of OpenWrt-based devices. One of the primary benefits is improved performance and reduced load on embedded devices such as WiFi routers. By rendering pages on the client-side using JavaScript, rather than on the router, this will reduce the workload on the router and improve the UX for those interacting with the LuCI web interface. This will be particularly beneficial for users with lower-specification routers etc. Another benefit of the new system is increased flexibility for developers. The use of a client-side JavaScript framework provides developers with more options for customizing and extending the LuCI web interface. And this also provides a standardized way for developers to interact with the router's services which should make it easier to develop and maintain LuCI-based applications.",

Over the past 2 years, MGnify has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.\n\n- WormBase (https://wormbase.org/) is one of the World's oldest active bioinformatic resources, more than 20 years old. We scan all published literature and datasets on the model organism C. elegans, to create a very comprehensive resouce of genomics, strains, experiments, paper and people, aimed towards accelerating research and discoveries in fundamental biology as well as human health.\n\n- The Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and its sibling project the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) are jointly responsible for defining the official names of genes in human and key vertebrate species. This official nomenclature ensures that studies and results on the same gene can easily be aggregated. \n\nGiven the rapid pace of generation of genomics and sequencing data, we support a fast-evolving software stack, and are constantly investigating new solutions for data storage, processing, distribution and display.\n\nPlease visit our projects page for ideas on potential GSoC projects:\nhttps://www.ensembl.info/about/projects/",

The goal is to enable researchers to easily compare taxonomic information from multiple studies for better interpretation and analysis of metagenomics data. Additionally, the project aims to streamline the process of user community contribution to MGnify Notebooks for improved accessibility and user experience. The project will be approached in three phases: research and evaluation of visualisation technologies, development of a Jupyter/observable notebook for comparing and visualising data from two studies, and integration of a JupyterLab extension to streamline the contribution process. The deliverables include a report on suitable visualisation technologies, a fully-functional Jupyter/Observable Notebook, and an integrated extension for user contributions. As a stretch goal, a component for the MGnify website that allows users to select multiple studies and launch a notebook for cross-study analyses will be developed.",

The pipeline will be designed to handle genome chunking and multiprocessing to ensure efficient use of computational resources.\n\nThe pipeline will take a genome sequence in FASTA format as input and use the RepeatModeler tool to generate a de novo repeat library for the input genome sequence. It will then use RepeatMasker to mask and annotate the repeats in the input genome sequence. Additionally, it will use Dust to mask and annotate low complexity sequences and TRF to mask and annotate tandem repeats in the input genome sequence. The pipeline will combine the results from these steps to output a masked genome sequence in FASTA format and annotated repeats in GTF format.\n\nFurthermore, the pipeline will use the tool RED to perform additional masking and output an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format. The pipeline will be deployed in the cloud using the Embassy Cloud within the EMBL-EBI infrastructure to allow for testing and scaling, with the aim of determining the cost of running it at scale.\n\nThe main problem that this proposal aims to solve is the challenge of identifying and masking repetitive elements in large and complex genome sequences. The pipeline will provide a detailed and informative annotation of the repeats within the genome, making it easier for researchers to analyze the non-repetitive regions of the genome.\n\nThe deliverables of this proposal will include a NextFlow pipeline for repeat annotation and masking, a de novo repeat library for the input genome sequence, a masked genome sequence in FASTA format with repeat, low complexity, and tandem repeat annotations, an annotated repeats file in GTF format, and an additional masked genome sequence in FASTA format generated using the tool RED.",

          "abstract_html": "Accurate gene annotation in eukaryotes solely based on genomic data has been a significant obstacle in biology since the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies and thus the rapid increase of available data. Traditional methods either rely on homology searches to map the open reading frames to previously identified protein-coding genes or utilize additional experimental data, e.g., transcriptomics data. The first approach produces potentially inaccurate results if the genome of interest is not at least somewhat related to an already annotated genome. The second approach is hindered because gathering transcriptomic data is labor-intensive and expensive. For that reason, there is a high demand for models that predict the location of protein-coding genes solely from inherent features of the DNA sequence of the gene. Although theoretically possible, methods that use, for instance, Hidden Markov models to detect protein-coding genes based on known gene features are often inaccurate. In this project, we will train a Deep Learning Transformer model to extract features of protein-coding genes to gain deeper insight into their exact properties that lead to translation. The whole workflow will include first training a Conditional Random Field model to recognize candidate gene regions and then using these as input for a more fine-grained Transformer - Convolutional Neural Network hybrid model. The final pipeline will be tested against a benchmark of gold standard annotations as well as various test sets to evaluate the influence of different parameters like genome sequence quality, protein length or gene structure complexity.",

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

This will be used half way through my project when I switch focus from a \"Linux from Scratch\" approach into working with Crossdev.\n\nDeliverables:\n+ Portage running on a llvm-libc/Linux system.\n+ Basic utilities for a terminal-based desktop.\n+ An experimental stage3 tarball for other users.\n+ Documentation on Gentoo wiki and blog posts.\n+ Being able to use Crossdev with the LLVM toolchain.",

      "description_html": "GeomScale is a research and development project that delivers open source code for state-of-the-art algorithms for problems at the intersection of data science, optimization, geometric, and statistical computing. The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration.",

The sampling methods - NUTS Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo, Reflective Exact HMC, and Riemannian Hamiltonian Monte Carlo - have already been implemented in C++ and integrated into the volesti codebase. The extended C++ bindings and Python wrappers will enable access to these methods through dingo.\n\nThis will involve running experiments on benchmark metabolic networks to compare the results obtained from the new random walks and the existing Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling method based on Billiard walk. The experiments will generate new biological insights by providing an exponential sampling of flux vectors, which will allow for an unbiased characterization of the metabolic capabilities of biochemical networks. The final deliverables of the project will be the extended dingo package, the results of the experiments, and a brief report discussing the findings.",

This separation will involve modifying the package description file, R documentation files and R source code files in the new R interface repository. Additionally, the existing tests will be adjusted to match the new package structure and a comprehensive set of test cases will be developed to cover all the essential features of the R interface. Furthermore, the R interface code will be updated to ensure compatibility with the latest versions. Lastly, thorough documentation will be created for the new R interface, explaining the functionality of various functions and arguments, providing practical examples of package usage and demonstrating how the R package integrates with the wider Volesti ecosystem.",

They'd have to write two custom widgets. First, they would write an answer widget that contains a sub-grid and links styles with the main grid. Then they'd modify the clue row widget for acrostics to support the different types of clues.\nAs a final step, a separate widget will be written to add a custom layout for acrostics.

          "abstract_html": "Many C++ standard library traits are often implemented using template metaprogramming, which can result in worse compilation performance due to expensive instantiations of multiple class templates. The most likely way to address the costly instantiations is to define compiler built-in traits and get library traits to dispatch to these built-ins. It is also essential to conduct thorough benchmarking and compare the existing implementations with built-in traits, as there may be some library traits that are already optimal or non-built-in approaches that outperform built-ins. Thus, the main goal of this project is to optimize the standard library traits by incorporating built-ins and investigating alternative approaches, with the aim of enhancing the compilation performance.",

          "abstract_html": "One pertinent use case of the gcc-python plugin was to provide the infrastructure for cpychecker, a static analysis tool designed for CPython extension modules. The primary objective of cpychecker was to assist programmers in identifying common coding errors in their extensions, which, in turn, could lead to difficult-to-find bugs in their systems. However, the gcc-python-plugin has suffered from bitrot over the years, and as a result, cpychecker ceased functioning several GCC releases ago. \n\nThe goal of this project is to port the functionalities of cpychecker to a -fanalyzer plugin, offering programmers a reliable tool for conducting static analysis of CPython extension modules once again in a more maintainable manner. The project will be divided into several logical components, such as reference count checking, format string checking, error handling checking, and verification of PyMethodDef tables. Accomplishing this task will involve building a -fanalyzer plugin and extending certain areas of the existing analyzer.",

However, these features are not fully exposed to users. The goal of this project would be to enable Non-Destructive Editing on individual layers and layer groups through “Layer Effects” such as drop shadows and brightness/contrast filters. A basic implementation consists of three milestones:\n\n1. Research and design a NDE workflow that compliments GIMP’s current design and user base.\n\n2. Implement “Layer Effects” for GIMP’s regular and text layers as well as layer groups.\n\n3. Add support to the PSD plug-in to recognize and import equivalent “Layer Styles” and “Adjustment Layers” as NDE Layer Effects.",

Currently octave-pythonic only supports python versions less than 3.10. But the latest python version is 3.11. The package has not been updated for a long time. My proposal is to improve the state of the package. Making octave-pythonic support the latest versions of python. Adding the missing features in the project. Fixing bugs from the bug tracker at GitLab. Implementing a python wrapper around octave types to use in python. Adding support for function callbacks and handles. And also adding support to use octave from python.",

It allows users to safely backup keys by giving shares to various independent escrow providers, and recover the secret by passing user-selected authentication challenges at a sufficiently large subset of these providers. GNU Taler is a digital payments system that uses cryptography to provide a certain degree of anonymity when paying things online.\n\nSome of the private keys that GNU Taler uses to represent money must be stored locally in the wallets, and thus, it is important to provide users with a way to ensure availability and confidentiality of these keys to avoid financial loss.\n\nThis proposal consists on the integration of GNU Anastasis in the Android wallet app of GNU Taler in order to allow users to make secure and decentralized backups of their digital wallets, and to recover the wallet data without relying on the user to safeguard their key material.\n\nGNU Anastasis' client logic is already available in TypeScript, just like the cryptographic core of the GNU Taler wallet.  Thus, to make this work, we need to link the GNU Anastasis client logic into the GNU Taler wallet and then systematically expose its functionality to the user interface implemented in Kotlin.\n\nIdeally, the resulting code should be re-usable outside of the GNU Taler wallet, for example as a stand-alone Android app to backup other key material or as re-usable Android dialogs that can be integrated with other Android apps in need for key backup and recovery functionality.",

          "abstract_html": "Many bug reports from almost 10 years ago to even recent times report that GNU Lilypond has been unable to correctly render note subdivision beams and tuple subdivisions, more evidently in some cases of complex rhythm and meter. After comprehensive assessment and analysis of these issues by the developers, the developers have determined that the current code responsible for those capabilities  should be rewritten and refactored.\n\nThe reason that note subdivision and beaming can be difficult to implement is that music theory heavily relies on powers of 2 and their reciprocals. It's very convenient to composers, instrument players and developers too. That convenience doesn't address the problems rhythmic complexity can pose. Concepts such as compound time signatures, tuplets (group of notes that are not bounded by the powers of 2) and manually setting relevant Lilypond attributes. My project proposes a new way of  representing the concept of music theory beams and groupings with different object attributes.\n\nMy project proposes to fix this Lilypond issue by rewriting `lily/beaming-pattern.cc` (the C++ source file mostly responsible for this issue's logic) and fixing/refactoring relevant C++/Scheme source files. I plan to first refactor such source files to fix regular note automatic subdivision and beaming, then fix tuplet subdivision in later weeks. Heavy code modifications will include updating documentation, adding regression tests, and formatting Lilypond's `convert-ly` rules corresponding to the above two issues.\n\nOnce the issue of beaming subdivisions is fixed, developers and even anyone wishing to compose rhythmically-complex scores should not have to worry about this obstacle.",

Currently, XaoS requires the user to download and install the software, which limits its accessibility. However, the current implementation of XaoS using Qt web assembly is not functioning well on web platforms due to issues with the synchronous, infinite loop used in XaoS's event loop. Browsers typically run JavaScript, which is single-threaded and relies on asynchronous events to avoid blocking the main thread, making the current implementation unsuitable. The proposed solution is to use a QTimer to periodically update the fractal using UIH functions. By refactoring the code to use a QTimer, XaoS can be made compatible with browser architecture and enable a single Qt source code for implementation across different platforms.",

Currently, there is no official Rust support for GNU/Hurd, which limits developers' ability to build high-performance, safe, and concurrent software on this platform. The Rust language is increasingly being used in fundamental libraries such as librsvg and python-cryptography, so it is crucial to have a compiler for Rust on GNU/Hurd. The Rust compiler is portable, but its runtime library, libstd, needs to be ported to GNU/Hurd. This involves telling Rust how to call standard C library functions, which can be generated from libc C headers using the bindgen tool. The proposed solution involves creating a new Rust target for GNU/Hurd by investigating the system calls and interfaces available in GNU/Hurd and adapting Rust's code generator to generate code that uses these interfaces. The project aims to optimize Rust's performance on the GNU/Hurd platform by identifying performance bottlenecks and implementing improvements where necessary. The deliverables of the project include the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain, which comprises the Rust compiler and libraries, documentation, and optimized performance of Rust on the GNU/Hurd platform. The project also includes researching the GNU/Hurd system, identifying the system calls and interfaces that Rust will need to use, and creating documentation for the Rust-GNU/Hurd toolchain.",

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

This project is broken down into a number of smaller projects, some of which involve adding new widgets like the compass display, MPEG display, and matrix sink, as well as strengthening the existing widgets by improving their code structures, making them more extendable, and reducing redundant code. The project additionally intends to enhance the gr-qtgui component's user interface by making it more understandable and user-friendly and by giving the user more power and customisation choices. In order to enable the creation of complete GUI applications from GRC, the project also entails the integration and support for QT Creator and QML design.",

There are a wide range of applications from assessing infrastructure such as bridges and roads, locating buried utilities, mapping glaciers, finding anti-personnel landmines, to detecting tumours in the human body, and exploring the sub-surface of Mars and the Moon.\n\ngprMax is command-line-driven software written in Python with performance-critical parts written in Cython. It does not currently feature a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows it to be very flexible and scriptable software that can run in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, i.e. on supercomputers.\n\ngprMax can be run on either CPU or GPU. The CPU solver has been parallelised using OpenMP which enables it to run on multi-core CPUs. The GPU solver has been developed using the NVIDIA CUDA programming model. gprMax also features a Messaging Passing Interface (MPI) task farm, which can operate with CPU nodes or multiple GPUs.",

Currently, such a source does not exist in gprMax. This project will involved translating existing code written by one of the mentors, taking the idea that has been shown to work as a MATLAB script and place it in a much larger environment, gprMax, in Python, blending it seamlessly with the other sources available in gprMax. Implementation of a simple plane wave source, propagating in a homogeneous medium seamlessly with the other sources available in gprMax.

          "abstract_html": "Faust is a functional programming language that enables people to express sound synthesis and audio processing algorithms concisely, efficiently, and portably. It is known for targeting a wide variety of environments: Faust code compiles to C, C++, LLVM IR and more, and for many different audio APIs and environments. In recent years, following the development of asm.js, Emscripten, Audio Worklets, and WebAssembly, the web has become an increasingly viable platform for DSP and audio programming. Prior work has enabled the generation of Audio Worklets (and older Script Processor Nodes) from Faust code. Furthermore, Faust has web-based tools such as an editor, IDE, and playground that allow people to easily try the language and hear the results without installing a compiler toolchain. I propose to improve Faust's support for the web platform by 1) updating and extending the Faust web tools and 2) building on Faust's ability to target WebAssembly in order to make Faust documentation more usable and to make it easier to find and share Faust code on the web.",

This lack of consistency and overall vision manifests itself in increased complexity, insufficient integration, and inefficient solutions, making the use of your computer more complicated than it should actually be.\n\nInstead, Haiku has a single focus on personal computing and is driven by a unified vision for the whole OS.

          "abstract_html": "Biologically detailed models are essential tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are frequently used to build and validate such models based on experimental data. The open-source parameter optimization software Neuroptimus was developed to enable easy application of  advanced parameter optimization methods, such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence, to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms, including PCs and supercomputers. While Neuroptimus uses various built-in cost functions and the eFEL feature extraction library to compare model behavior to experimental data, it severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by optimization. However, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows for the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors. Therefore, the goal of this project is to extend Neuroptimus to use HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit, to evaluate model performance during optimization. This project aims to develop a seamless integration between HippoUnit and Neuroptimus, enabling the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons. The new Neuroptimus-HippoUnit integration will allow the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors, which can ultimately lead to improved biophysical models of hippocampal neurons.\nDeliverables: \n1- Implementation of an interface between HippoUnit and the new version of Neuroptimus to enable the optimization of a broader range of neuronal behaviors.\n2- Extend the current supported tests to include all HippoUnit tests.\n3- Integrate the HippoUnit with the Neuroptimus’s GUI so that users can run optimizations directly from the interface.",

          "abstract_html": "ASSR refers to the cortical entrainment to frequency and phase of an auditory signal that is presented in a fixed “train of clicks”, in a gamma range rhythm (40 Hz). A hallmark of schizophrenia is a reduction in ASSR; this project aims at reproducing this phenomenon using an auditory cortex (A1) model with thalamocortical connectivity. The latter simulates a cortical column with a depth of 2000 μm and 200 μm diameter, containing over 12k neurons and 30M synapses. Specifically, we aim at reproducing results from an experiment looking at the effects of increased CB1 receptor availability and GABA receptor deficits, as these have been linked to the EEG abnormalities that characterize schizophrenia. We will start by running batch simulation tasks to pull out connectivity rules from the A1 model, modifying GABA and CB1 Receptors. This step will be run on a scaled version of the A1, so that I will be able to use a personal computer, but I may employ cloud resources as well.Then, we will analyze parameter sweeps for local field potentials, using the LFPy toolbox. Afterwards, we will move to parameter optimization of the A1 model so that it reproduces the ASSR, using the Optuna HPO toolkit. Our ultimate goal is to reproduce the ASSR phenomenon in the A1 model. For every step of the process, documentation will be made available on a deployed site.",

CellSAM, initially a segment-anything model, was fine-tuned to allow promptable segmentation of cellular structures in microscopy images. Conversely, DevoNet, a dual vision encoder model, operates seamlessly on 3D TIFF files. One encoder is trained on segmentation maps while the other specializes in analyzing the centroid position of cells. This synchronized operation aids in the precise calculation of cellular volume, area, and centroid locations. The collaborative mechanism between the fine-tuned CellSAM and DevoNet models provides a robust framework for more accurate and insightful analysis of 3D cellular microscopy images, thereby broadening the understanding of cellular morphologies and interactions within a three-dimensional space.",

Over the last four years, the book has  grown significantly, making it challenging to navigate. The team created a Python package in 2022 to enhance The Turing Way's usability by enabling various access points to the book depending on the user profile or persona. But before integrating the feature provided by the package to Turing Way , there are some improvements that need to be made to allow a better user experience. The project aims at improving the Python Package to enhance the usability of The Turing Way. The following approach will be used to achieve this goal : -\n\n1- Making browsing experience less confusing by modifying chapter links and profile tags based on a selected ‘pathway’, rather than displaying all tags associated with a chapter. \n\n2- Adding a feature to provide descriptions for each pathway which will improve user experience allowing meaningful use of books by all profile types. \n\n3- Implementing the solutions proposed in this application and integrating them into The Turing Way via the open source framework.",

The objective of this project is to create a Pydra worker class capable of submitting and monitor jobs on different HPC systems, such as Theta, using PSI/J. Furthermore, I intend to use Bokeh to construct an interactive web-based dashboard that will monitor the jobs being submitted and executed by the Pydra worker. The expected outcome of this project is a Pydra worker that can use PSI/J to submit and track jobs on various HPC systems, an updated Dask worker, as well as a jobs monitoring dashboard.\n\nThe proposed methodology involves designing and implementing the Pydra worker class, evaluating its functionality and performance on various systems, comparing it to existing Pydra workers, and constructing a Pydra dashboard using Bokeh to monitor the jobs. Finally, I will document the usage and installation of the Pydra worker with PSI/J, as well as the Pydra dashboard, and provide users with examples and tutorials. The project timeline includes a community bonding phase from May 4 to 28, followed by an extended coding period from May 29 to September 17.",

HNN requires the hand-tuning of a large set of parameters until a close fit between simulated and recorded data is attained. This hand-tuning can take a\nsubstantial amount of effort thus it is in the user’s best interest to automate the process so that parameters can be optimized in a time efficient manner. The goal of this project is to develop optimization functions that will perform a wide search over the parameter space to arrive at faithful simulations. HNN is currently being used to develop or test hypotheses about underlying circuitry that gives rise to cognitive processes of interest. Developing a robust algorithm for parameter optimization has the potential to illuminate avenues for the diagnosis and treatment of multiple brain disorders and diseases, cognitive impairment, and psychiatric disorders. Finally, contribution to HNN’s codebase will aid researchers who use the tool in yielding important constraints to the development of theories about the origins of human brain responses.",

TVB is currently the only neuroinformatics project providing a platform for researchers to work together on modeling studies using brain network models with realistic connectivity.\n\nThe modeling of the simulations requires datasets generally hosted on data storage platforms like Zenodo, OpenSourceBrain, EBRAINS, etc. One has to download the dataset manually, unzip it and then use it inside the web GUI. \n\nInstead of manually downloading and unzipping the data, the project's goal is to have a dedicated framework to manage the downloading and unzipping the dataset from remote sources.

The interface should show other visualization options like histograms, pie charts, multi-series line charts, pie charts, graphs, and visualizations representing data with more than two dimensions, e.g., 3D Scatter plots, 3D Mesh Plots, 3D line plots, box plots, and bubble charts. \n\nThe third deliverable is the ability for users to add publications related to the datasets in a project. We will achieve this by creating a text editor page where users can add content, edit content, remove content, add tables, and add images. The text editor should allow users to add latex code so that users can publish mathematical analyses of the findings. We will also implement a page that gets the list of publications, which should contain clickable items that redirect to another page that details the publication. \n\nFinally, we will refactor some of the code to maintain a better project structure, encapsulate numerous fragments of the same code in another method to improve the readability of the code and remove deprecated methods.",

      "description_html": "Computational thinking for all with free visual coding apps\nThe Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.",

          "abstract_html": "The objective of this proposal is to enhance the user experiences for readers of Open Library through a two-prong approach. \n\nThe first prong, Improving Site Performance, addresses the poor site performance that negatively affects our patrons’ experience. This prong takes a metric-based approach to identify the key bottlenecks of performance using various performance measurement tools. This metric-based approach allows us to identify the areas for performance optimisation and quantify the effects of our changes. \n\nThe second prong, Implementing Subject Tags, seeks to offer a more resourceful alternative to the Subject tags that are currently implemented for books in Open Library. The current Subject tags, which are implemented as a list of strings, are limited in extensibility and scalability, and are not an efficient tool in categorising and providing information about books. Subject Tags will be implemented as first-class objects, allowing for metadata to be included within tags. The metadata will provide relationships and hierarchy between subjects, internationalisation (i18n) information, additional description about tags and many other extensible information fields. Upon the success of this implementation, its utility will catalyse improvement within numerous avenues in the Open Library system which includes the search engine, Subject page interface, content advisory and many more. \n\nThese two prongs work together to improve the overall patron experience, making the site more enjoyable to use and enriching the information about books.",

          "abstract_html": "Have you ever encountered a frustrating error when browsing a webpage, or perhaps landed on a page expecting to find information about the first computer, only to discover something completely unrelated?\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we request a webpage, the server communicates its status through an HTTP response code. If the page is broken or doesn't exist, the server responds with a 404 error code or some other error code in the 4xx and 5xx range, indicating an issue, and 200 OK (or some other status codes in the 2xx range) if everything is good. However, a common challenge arises when the server returns a 200 OK in every case, making it difficult for computers to differentiate between a healthy page and a problematic one. If these problematic pages go unnoticed and are not replaced with their healthy counterparts over time, they contribute to a pervasive issue known as \"link rot,\" leading to the gradual loss of valuable internet information.\n\n\n\nThis work addresses such issues by performing content analysis of webpages to identify potential soft-404s that would otherwise go undetected due to the wrong HTTP status code they return. A prior version of such soft-404 pages is then looked up in the Wayback Machine to replace the link in the Wikipedia article with, if present.",

In addition to automatically identifying and retrieving related or quoted documents, the system will enable users to look for and retrieve pertinent documents based on author, date, and other metadata. To do this, we will create a set of APIs and ingestion protocols that allow text data to be parsed and tagged while utilising ensemble learning, W2V, and LSA/LDA algorithms to produce tailored suggestions based on user preferences. Additionally, we'll put in place a user-friendly front-end interface that allows API-based queries, extensive unit testing, and optimisation.\n\nA completely working document retrieval and recommendation system, as well as a strong set of APIs and ingestion protocols for processing sizable amounts of text data, will be included in our deliverables. In-depth documentation outlining the system's design, implementation, and usage policies will also be made available. Our overall goal is to offer organisations looking to extract valuable insights from their text data a creative and practical solution that will allow for improved business outcomes and more informed decision-making.",

For example, a lot of information can be visualized about an AS including its Prefixes, IXP, Peer ASes, Sibling Ases, etc. I propose to develop a search page for the Internet Yellow Pages which is self-exploratory.

The software is mainly used for rapid prototyping, teaching, forensics, and in the medical field. It is possible to use it on the Microsoft Windows, GNU/Linux and Apple Mac OS X platforms. \n\nInVesalius main software started began their development on 2001 by Centro de Tecnologia da Informação Renato Archer (CTI), in Brazil, later it was released under GNU license and more practitioners joins the organization to improve their development.\n\nAt that time, there was no medical image software in Portuguese that fulfilled the Brazilian hospitals and clinics needs. Therefore, InVesalius came as a proposal of development with the aim to be a medical software image analysis with null acquisition cost, capability of execution on low-cost personal computers and the\ncapability of execution on different operating systems and act as a platform to encourage the use and development of medical images in Brazil.",

InVesalius allows uploading a set of images from CT or MRI and then it shows the Coronal, Sagittal and Axial planes and also allows the application of masks to reconstruct the images in three dimensions. Currently InVesalius does not have integration with PACS systems, this means that all the files are handled by the application.\n\nThe suggested proposal presents a schedule to integrate multiple PACS systems with InVesalius.

          "abstract_html": "Currently InVesalius does not support simultaneous visualization of structural MRI and fMRI volumes. This is however of large interest to visualize both modalities for people involved in the clinical and analytical domain. Indeed a direct implication would be to have functional connectivity induced graphs visible along with structural connections (white matter). On top of which, after generating 3d maps, it may then be possible to visualize in space the functional connections versus structural connections. \n\nFirst of all, this project would be a useful feature to InVesalius, but secondly also to the neuroscience community. By having InVesalius open source and in a UI format it would enable clinical experts or neuroscientists without engineering background to have ready to go visualization of fMRI and structural MRI volumes. In general this could be extended to other modalities as well.\n\nTwo possible ways to simultaneously visualize structural MRI and fMRI are: \n\n1. Overlay different masks or contrasts (need to be carefully picked) for each of the two modality. There might be a need to apply some color distribution matching between structural and functional (e.g histogram equalization) since one would be T1 and the other T2 to have better visualization. Both slices would need to be co-registered prior to overlaying. The effect on the generation of 3D visualization would also be cared for.\n\n2. Having two views or preview of fMRI in each orientation (sagittal, coronal, axial and 3d).\n Two views or one main view and a preview would require to have a tracker (dot) that points to the same voxels in the two views. This could be a way for the user to match regions for instance and essentially avoid crowding the visualization.\n\nThe language I plan on using and believe fits the project would be python. The potential libraries used during the project would include already required ones for InVesalius (e.g scipy,opencv)",

Currently, the platform offers 26 exercises and 11 prototype exercises that students can access through the RoboticsAcademy docker image (RADI), which comes pre-installed with all necessary dependencies. The RADI is a key component of the platform, and this project aims to improve it by migrating it to ROS2 Humble Hawksbill from the current ROS noetic version, which is nearing its end of life (2025). The project will involve implementing a few exercises in ROS2 with the new RADI as well as the addition of ROS2 tools such as RViz2 to exercises. Additionally, the project may explore topics such as size optimization, multi-rosdistro docker images, and hardware acceleration.",

Jenkins' motto is \"Build great things at any scale\". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.\n\nThis year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins. We have many strategic project ideas which are important to potentially hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users.\n\nThe project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.). Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure and Remoting) and special interest groups. These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project.\n\nThe Jenkins project is a part of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).",

          "abstract_html": "Project Abstract\n\nThe project proposes to add new probes to the Plugin Health Score tool. Originally started in 2022 as a part of a GSoC project, this tool determines the health score of a plugin. Probes are the heart of the tool. To extend the work started last year, I propose adding new probes to make the tool more valuable and feature-complete. \n\nProject Description\n\nJenkins is an almost two-decade-old open-source project with over 1000 repositories. Plugins bridge the gap between Jenkins and different environments. \nA project as mature and large-scale as Jenkins requires active involvement from active maintainers. \n\nIn general, probes serve two purposes within the context of this toolset: \nTo collect the data to compute the score of the plugin systematically. Based on the computed score, the health of the plugin can be determined.\nBased on the score future contributors, maintainers, and adopters decide which plugin(s) they want to invest their time in. \n\n\nProject Deliverables\n\nDesigning of the probes\nIdentify the key features and functionality of the plugins.\nDefine the metrics that would contribute to the Plugin Health Score.\nThe more probe criteria the plugin meets, the higher the health score of the plugin.\n\nDeciding the probe’s interaction with other probes\n\nDetermining how the probe would contribute to the score.\n\nAdding unit test cases for each probe and scoring implementation. If time permits, I will add integration test cases too.\n\nThe final delivery would be 10 new probes to the Plugin Health Scoring System. \nThese probes will contribute to calculating the overall health of a plugin.\nBy the time the project ends, the tool will approximately have 24 probes in all (10 new + 14 existing probes)\n\nProposed Implementation Plan \n\n- Build each probe, implement it, score it and write its test cases. \n\n- Define interaction of probes with each other.\n\n- Define execution order of each probe.\n\nStretch Goals\n\n- Adding metrics probe\n- Writing integration test cases",

The process of getting started with Jenkins with docker is too complex and the available documentation is also hard to understand making it challenging for new users to get started. By simplifying the use of Jenkins with Docker, we can enable more developers to take advantage of these powerful tools together and accelerate their software development process. The main point of the project is to simplify the spinning up of the container to run a Jenkins instance with a single command. That’s where Docker-compose comes to the rescue which uses YAML files to spin up multi-container setups. The expected outcomes after completion of the project are an elegant docker-compose file, comprehensive documentation on the workings of these docker-compose files with examples, a Jenkinsfile will be added to ci.jenkins.io with instructions to check the docker-compose files and as these docker-compose files will be able to run on Gitpod we will be able to create a one-click setup for Jenkins using docker and Gitpod.",

          "abstract_html": "Sustainability is a key goal for KDE over the next two years. As part of this goal, KDE aims to measure the energy consumption of its software and eco-certify applications with the Blue Angel ecolabel.\nCurrently, we measure the energy consumption of our software using a lab based in Berlin following the process documented in the KDE Eco Handbook (Handbook: Applying The Blue Angel Criteria To Free Software).\nThe lab setup requires (i) a test PC (System Under Test) to run user-emulation scripts, (ii) a power meter to measure the energy consumption of the test PC, and (iii) another PC (Data Aggregator & Evaluator) to collect and analyze the output data. In the current setup, developers must rely on individuals in Berlin to test software for them on-site in the lab.\nThis proposal aims to provide remote access to the lab in two steps: first, automating the energy measurement process, including providing a summary of the results; and second, setting up backend CI/CD integration for measuring energy consumption.\nBy automating the process and providing remote access, we make it possible for developers to measure the energy consumption of their software from any location in the world. The increased access to the lab will enable data-driven decision-making for efficiency improvements in code and software eco-certification with agencies like the Blue Angel.\nThe proposed project has three main goals:\ni) Measurement Automation: Implement a solution where a developer provides as input three scripts (baseline, idle mode, and standard usage scenario) with a config file and automatically obtains a summary of results from  OSCAR (Open source Software Consumption Analysis in R).\nii) Remote Access 1: Implement a CI/CD pipeline as a backend solution for performing the energy consumption measurements in the remote energy measurement lab.",

Since the UI has been deprecated, we need to make sure that the CLI is fully functional and easy to scale and modify in the upcoming years. For that, we need to have a stable API with the correct design decisions, since backwards compatibility for big projects is a must.\n\nThe secondary goal of this project is to make the developer experience smooth as well. Keploy works, but the code is all over the place, unit test logic is embedded with actual code, there are lots of internal context on functions that should be better documented, etc.\n\nThe last goal is to make it easy for the maintainers of the project to accept contributions from outsiders. Currently, one of the maintainers needs to manually test the changes locally to ensure that no regression has been caused. We need to automate this process, requiring stricter unit tests (which would only be feasible for newcomers if we have the framework in place).",

The plugin will be able to retrieve relevant information about coroutines at any state of the program and leverage this information to generate a parallel stacks view. This will provide developers with a comprehensive overview of the execution flow of their coroutines, allowing them to more effectively identify and resolve issues in their code.

Furthermore, the project will enhance the library's documentation, integration tests, and examples to provide a comprehensive user experience.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of this project encompass:\n- Comprehensive documentation with practical usage examples\n- A user-friendly API that simplifies the benchmarking process\n- Versatile options for benchmarking Kotlin/JVM code across various platforms\n\nTo successfully execute this project, proficiency in Kotlin and an understanding of Gradle internals are essential.

It is complemented by a curricular tool, a library of open educational materials, and a toolkit of resources to support training and implementation. These tools are open and available in a variety of languages, to better support learners and educators globally.\nAs a community-driven nonprofit, Learning Equality works closely to co-design Kolibri with a core network of collaborators, including national NGOs, UN agencies, government, and corporate partners. We also adopt a needs-based approach, constantly gathering insights from our community to inform the development of our tools. \nThrough its do-it-yourself adoption model and strategic collaborations, Kolibri has reached learners and educators in more than 220 countries and territories since its launch in 2017.",

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor.

Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.\n\nTo address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.",

It communicates with LibreHealth RIS module to output labels on DICOM viewer.\n\nCurrently, CheXnet model is integrated to the AI Model service, but the proposal expands to apply other models to imaging modalities like Mammo, Head CT, Abdomen CT. The project aims to understand what radiologists need in terms of AI and implement it. The goal is to help radiologists perform better by implementing algorithms for new imaging modalities.\n\nTo tackle the problem we start by looking at research that have looked deep into model architectures and methods that work well with imaging modalities, for example Alexnet have proven to work on modalities like Head CT. We then collect the imaging data necessary to train out models and also decide on the method of training like transfer learning on pretrained models or do we go ahead with training a model from scratch. Appropriate feature engineering and tuning will be part of the problem solving process. Once we establish a model to perform well on a modality we proceed to integrate the model to the AI Model service application.\n\nThe deliverables will include\n- Collate information on data sources, methods and models that will be used for implementation and review with mentor(s)\n- For any modality, start with data preparation, feature engineering, training and evaluation until satisfactory performance is achieved. Here we will trial different augmentation techniques and hyperparameter tuning methods. \n- Integrate the model inferencing code and retraining code to the application for all modalities\n- Add methods to the Flask API to appropriately call the specific AI model for a modality. Modify existing methods as necessary so as to include the new AI models\n- Perform unit tests, integration tests, functional tests and end to end tests for the implementations. Necessary coding standards will be used.",

      "description_html": "LibreOffice is a modern Free & Open Source Office suite, one of the largest open source projects, and used by millions of users worldwide. LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

A lot of unit tests are run in Jenkins when contributers submit their patches to gerrit. It usually takes hours to run all the tests across different platforms, especially in rush hours. Therefore, a better test selection method is needed to reduce the load in testing while maintaining a high software quality.\n\nRecently, machine learning is used to predict whether a patch can pass a given test. This can greatly reduce the testing load because we can skip the tests that is very likely to pass when a patch is submitted. Although feature engineering isn't trivial, transformers have been proved useful in feature extraction under similar problem settings. Therefore, I propose that we can implement a machine learning based test selection method to select tests to run in the CI chain to reduce testing load.",

A high level API which will internally use the low level async API for uploads and downloads will also be created which will make uploads/downloads easier for the user and more efficient since the async API is used internally.\n\nThe set of deliverables for this project will be : a low level async API for writing, a high level API for upload and download,  tests for the created API's, benchmark code to analyse performance of the API's, documentation for the created API's.",

      "description_html": "Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face! \nThis year also we’ll allow the use of Cloud-based services, like Google’s models Gemini and Palm2.",

We use “google_maps_flutter” for the live location of the user, “google_directions_api” for finding routes to the nearest launch site and “geocoding” to convert the named launch site location to coordinates. After calling the API it will return data in JSON format which we will convert to KML format file and store it locally using “shared_preferences” and then will send it to Liquid Galaxy for visualisation. There will be a map screen as well in the app to visualise the launch in the app itself if it is not connected to Liquid Galaxy.

The application offers a unique way to visualize satellite orbits using the Liquid Galaxy rig (Google Earth) and a real-world Arduino-controlled pointer. It also provides insights into satellites' movements and access to vital satellite information seamlessly within the app.\n\nI plan to develop this by getting all the satellite data from SatNOGS database through API calls. Then, we use SGP-4 model to convert TLE of a satellite to get the state (position and velocity). Then we convert the satellite state to KML format. We segregate the KML data into the various tracks to get a neater visualization of the satellite's orbit data. Then, we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualize this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig.  \n\nNext, we make Arduino controlled pointer which emits green laser in the direction of satellite, which is controlled by the app.  First, we 3D print the STL files of the 3D projector. Then, we assemble all the components of the Arduino-controlled pointer. Then, for the application, we use flutter_bluetooth_serial package to connect and send data to HC-05 module. Then, we use SGP-4 model to get the servo motor angles for the Arduino pointer. Then, we upload code to Arduino to receive data.",

The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.\n\nLLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.",

In general hot functions can only be identified at runtime (different inputs will cause different functions to become hot), so the aim of the reoptimization project is to build infrastructure to (1) detect hot functions at runtime and (2) compile them a second time at a higher optimization level, hence the name \"re-optimization\".\n\nThere are many possible approaches to both parts of this problem. E.g. hot functions could be identified by sampling, or using existing profiling infrastructure, or by implementing custom instrumentation. Reoptimization could be applied to whole functions, or outlining could be used to enable optimization of portions of functions. Re-entry into the JIT infrastructure from JIT’d code might be implemented on top of existing lazy compilation, or via a custom path.\n\nWhatever design is adopted, the goal is that the infrastructure should be generic so that it can be used by other LLVM API clients, and should support out-of-process JIT-compilation (so some of the solution will be implemented in the ORC runtime).",

Said representation would greatly benefit the community by enabling a myriad of passes that are either impossible or too complex to execute in LLVM IR, benefiting thousands of developers and legacy code.

This proposal aims to increment the ClangIR compiler to compile part of the LLVM’s SingleSource test suite, further advancing its development. This includes but is not limited to, implementing missing AST visitors, operations/instructions, types, and testing. After sufficient implementations, it should be possible to use the SingleSource programs to analyze the compilation through ClangIR, evaluating its trade-offs against the traditional lowering process.",

The project incorporates the completion infrastructure of Cling into Clang-REPL. Next, we build components that handle type contexts and subtyping. Lastly, we combine the completion and type-related components to deliver the type-directed auto-completion in Clang-REPL.",

Starting with GSoC 2022 and continuing over the last year several potential solutions have been developed and shared with the community via patches and RFCs. This has helped to build further understanding of both front-end and internal LLVM limitations. Based on the latest RFC two possible semantic solutions have been identified that allow loads to migrate to poison by default and provide backward compatibility with the current load undef semantics. This is accomplished by either freezing all bits regardless of initialization state or byte-level freezing based on initialization state. By implementing both solutions real-world performance metrics and maintenance impact can be evaluated by the LLVM community. This work will increase use of poison semantics further contributing to the eventual deprecation of undef.",

This has many advantages but can make it difficult to predict which code path is executed when the compiler is invoked with a certain test input, especially for edge cases where error handling is involved. The goal of this project is to help developers create good test coverage for their patch and enable reviewers to verify that they have done so. To accomplish this we would like to introduce a tool that can be fed a patch as input, add coverage instrumentation for the affected source files, runs Lit tests, and records which test cases cause each counter to be executed. For each counter we can then report the number of test cases executing the counter, but perhaps more importantly we can also report the number of test cases executing the counter that are also changed in some way by the patch, since a modified line that results in the same test results isn’t properly tested, unless it’s intended to be a non-functional change.",

Gamma-ray spectrometers are among the sensors used for this task.

However, accurately deriving abundance just from gamma-ray spectra is an intractable problem. \r\nMachine learning (ML) has been widely used to address intractable problems, including the unmixing of spectral signatures in the visible and near-infrared (VNIR) region of the electromagnetic spectrum. Therefore, this proposal outlines the development of an ML model for estimating elements from gamma-ray spectra.

The Higgs boson which is a heavy and highly unstable elementary particle is not present in nature but is generated in high energy collisions. Because it’s unstable and decays before reaching the edge of the detector, we study it by observing its decay products which tend to form conical jets and then reconstruct the Higgs bosons from these observations. One technique we might use to reconstruct these particles is to pass the kinematic variables (momentum, energy, etc.) to a transformer autoencoder while masking either subsets of kinematics or the kinematics for an entire particle.

It also involves tuning hyperparameters and exploring the use of other transformer architectures like TabTransformer for this task.

          "abstract_html": "Machine learning algorithms are heavily relied on to understand the data generated at the European Council for Nuclear Research's (CERN) Large Hadron Collider (LHC) which produces immense amounts of data through the measurement of the products of particle collisions. Since data from these events can typically be formed into a graph structure, deep geometric methods, such as graph neural networks (GNNs), have been used as an approach to various HEP anlysis tasks. One such task is jet tagging, where jets are viewed as point clouds with distinct features and edge connections between their constituent particles. To enhance the validity and robustness of deep networks, embedded symmetries, which are present in many physically realizable datasets and fundamental physical theories, can also be discovered by the model through the use of invariant I(n) and equivariant networks E(n). However, due to the increasing size and complexity of these datasets, as well as the models which process them, an involved yet computationally inexpensive approach must be utilized. To handle an increase in the complexity of the data, I suggest the implementation of a classical attention (AT) transformer with the necessary modifications to incorporate, invariant or equivariant, and GNN layers. As the extension of classical algorithms via bit-wise processes to quantum algorithms via qubit-wise processes has been rapidly developing over the last few years, I propose the full development of general quantum invariant and equivariant graph attention transformer (QIGAT or Quantum Informer, QEGAT or Quantum Equiformer) architectures to meet the demands of requiring these machine learning algorithms to offer enhanced robustness through the adherence to fundamental physical principles while reducing their computational cost.",

          "abstract_html": "Strong gravitational lensing is a promising probe of the substructure of dark matter to better understand its underlying nature. Deep learning methods have the potential to accurately identify images containing substructure, and differentiate WIMP particle dark matter from other well-motivated models, including axions and axion-like particles, cold dark matter etc. Gravitational lensing data is often collected at low resolution due to limitations of the instruments or observing conditions. Image super-resolution techniques can be used to enhance the resolution of these images with machine learning, allowing for more precise measurements of the lensing effects and a better understanding of the distribution of matter in the lensing system. This can improve our understanding of the mass distribution of the lensing galaxy and its environment, as well as the properties of the background source being lensed. This project will focus on the development of deep learning-based image super-resolution techniques to enhance the resolution of gravitational lensing data. Furthermore, we will also investigate leveraging the super-resolution models for other strong lensing tasks such as regression and lens finding.",

Leveraging relativistic equations and Singular Isothermal Spherical models, Lensiformer accurately approximates the gravitational potential exerted by lensing galaxies and dark matter. These physics-based features are integrated into a Vision Transformer (ViT) neural network, providing a nuanced understanding of different dark matter structures like Cold Dark Matter and No-Substructure Dark Matter, and their associated gravitational imprints on light paths and galaxy distortions. To validate the model, we generate a specialized dataset using real galaxy images as source objects and benchmark Lensiformer against other leading models, confirming its superior performance in discerning different kinds of dark matter morphologies.",

This is a common occurrence in the case of Strong gravitational lensing images when samples from one or more classes are scarcer than others. On the other hand, when there are few data labels available for supervision, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) has been shown to perform better than conventional supervised learning. SSL can also create meaningful representations from very vast unlabelled datasets that would be challenging or impossible to label manually. Additionally, transformer-based architectures recently have emerged as a paradigm to solve a wide range of tasks in computer vision from image classification to object detection. They have a number of advantages over traditional methods, including dynamic weight adjustment based on input features, global context, and improved generalization. Thus, the project aims to train transformer architecture in Self-Supervised Learning fashion to learn generic features.

Sometimes the resources are not readily accessible, or the channel of communication is simply missing. Many people have questions about government policies but don’t know where to ask or never bother to read through official documents; instead, they end up getting incomplete or misleading information from the web. \nThese issues call for a system that handles queries on a large scale with high efficiency and consistency - this is where large language models (LLM) come into the picture. With the help of exciting tools like LlamaIndex, we are now able to extend the knowledge base of LLMs like ChatGPT to more specific domains and tailor the model’s responses to be more relevant to the residents’ needs. \n\nThis project will extend ChatGPT’s knowledge base with specific government data (such as pdfs of housing policies) and provide a frontend interface for user to interact with a ChatGPT-style chatbot. In addition to the ability to chat and ask questions, users will also be given the power to evaluate responses of the chatbot by giving a thumb up/thumb down to the response.",

      "description_html": "MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Welcoming documentation such as the User Guide https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/ make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than almost two thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",

Potentially, it will allow researchers to run analysis of the molecular dynamics trajectories much faster, depending on their access to HPC facilities, hence increasing the speed of obtaining valuable insights from large-scale molecular simulations.\n\nBriefly, the proposal aims to re-write protocol for `MDAnalysis.AnalysisBase.run()` method to use a scheduler-based approach. This is supposed to be done with gradually increasing complexity, covering each steps with respective tests to ensure backward compatibility:\n - simply re-write the protocol without adding additional complexity such as multiple processes\n - add multiple cores for a single node\nAt this point, a mid-project checkpoint is set.\n - introduce cluster support that allows user to run analysis in an HPC environment with a `dask` backend\n - (optional) add tests for subclasses of the base class, and mark those that don't support such parallelization\n - (optional) add example jupyter notebook showing that a large-scale molecular dynamics trajectory can be analyzed in a parallel fashion much faster than before",

The database tracks area types like countries, cities, districts, etc. to indicate the location of recording studios, artist birthplaces, concert halls, and events. But considering the scope of the database, MusicBrainz refers to external databases like Wikidata & GeoNames to keep its area metadata up-to-date. However, adding areas to the database is currently a manual process, which is cumbersome, causes delays, and prevents frequent updates on outdated areas. With this GSoC project, we aim to tackle this issue by building a new Mechanize based “AreaBot” written in Python (similar to the old Perl Bot) to automatically maintain and update areas in MusicBrainz using Wikidata.",

      "description_html": "When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.\n\nIt addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.\n\nFinally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.",

The framework is used by network security professionals to perform penetration tests, system administrators to verify patch installations, product vendors to perform regression testing, and security researchers world-wide. The framework is written in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C, many flavors of Assembly, Python, Powershell, PHP, and other languages.\n\nThe framework consists of tools, libraries, modules, and user interfaces. The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.",

It supports unlimited staves, linked parts and part extraction, tablature, MIDI input and output, percussion notation, cross-staff beaming, automatic transposition, lyrics (multiple verses), fretboard diagrams, and in general everything commonly used in sheet music.\n\nStyle options to change the appearance and layout are available and style sheets can be saved and applied to other scores. In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.\n\nMuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.\n\nThe team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.\n\nAll members provide bug tracking support and feedback.",

However, the datasets produced by mass spectrometry instruments are complex and multi-dimensional. MZmine (https://mzmine.org; implemented in Java and JavaFX) and MS-DIAL (http://prime.psc.riken.jp/compms/msdial/main.html; implemented in C#) are popular open-source graphical software tools for mass spectrometry data processing. Both contain a library of processing algorithms and powerful visualization modules. \n\nBoth MZmine and MS-DIAL are highly cited (>4500 cumulated citations in Pluskal et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2010 and Tsugawa et al., Nature Methods 2015) demonstrating the impact the software tools have in the biomedical research community.  \n\nMZmine 3 is based on JavaFX for its user interface and provides support for cutting-edge techniques such as ion mobility separation. We aim to provide user-friendly, flexible, and extendable modular software covering the entire mass spectrometry data analysis workflow. \n\nMS-DIAL 5 follows the mind of MZmine, and the program is written by C# and WPF. As the unique functions, the program supports the chromatogram deconvolution for data independent acquisition. Furthermore, MS-DIAL 5 also supports the annotation function for various mass fragmentation techniques, mass spectrometry imaging, and proteomics, resulting in the environment for multiomics analysis.\n\nMZmine successfully participated in Google Summer of Code in the years 2017, 2018, and 2019 under the OpenChemistry umbrella, and in 2020 and 2022 as its own organization. Now both MZmine and MS-DIAL projects team up for  GSoC 2023.",

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), WikiPathways (https://wikipathways.org/), SBML (https://sbml.org/), and SBGN (https://sbgn.github.io/). This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing! For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over 18,000 times per month by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our 95% success rate (https://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don’t take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).",

The idea of integrating Pathway Commons, which is an aggregated database of molecular interactions of approximately 20 databases, brings in scope to analyze data and obtain better results. However, the data lies in GMT format due to which it requires additional functions to bind pathways with their name and gene. It is then saved in RDS format to feed the enricher() function to obtain an enrichResult object. We perform ORA and GSEA using some functions defined in R script on Pathway Commons data to support it in clusterProfiler.\n\nWith the advent of a new technique ssGSEA (single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) used to quantify the activity of a specific pathway or gene set in individual sample,for example, analyzing heterogeneous samples (tumor samples), integration of ssGSEA with clusterProfiler will help in better medical analyses. Thus, using packages like GSVA(Gene set variation analysis) and GenePattern we can calculate enrichment scores in permutations and support ssGSEA  in clusterProfiler.",

The following deliverables define the proposal’s success: the trained Pytorch model should reproduce the same results as the current Tensorflow model; the new Pytorch code base should be configured to be able to run on multiple platforms (Linux, Mac, …); and the github should have clear documentations for installing and running the model.",

Of these is Bambi, a Python library built on top of the PyMC PPL, that makes it easy to specify complex generalized linear multilevel models using a formula notation similar to those found in R. However, as the model building portion of the Bayesian workflow becomes easier, the interpretation of these models has not. Currently, to aid in model interpretability, Bambi only supports conditional adjusted predictions plots. The objective is to take inspiration from the existing Bambi tooling and R package marginaleffects, to extend upon existing plotting functionality and to provide additional plotting functions such as conditional comparisons and conditional marginal effects to allow Bambi modelers to extract insights and interpret their models in a more automatic and effective manner.",

          "abstract_html": "(This project is for CVXPY)\nThe performance of canonicalization procedures for optimization problems is an important metric for CVXPY users. Typically, this process is quite slow for large Disciplined Parametrized Programs(DPP). However, it is possible to improve upon the canonicalization by replacing the way 3D sparse tensors are represented.\nOne of the major updates of CVXPY 1.3 was the addition of a SciPy backend, which allowed a performance speedup for certain types of optimization problems. This new backend offers an alternative to the original C++ backend implementation (CVXCORE), and enables easier development. \nThe SciPy backend has some limitations especially when it comes to manipulating sparse tensors with 3 dimensions. The current representation of a 3D sparse tensor is to use a list of 2D matrices. However, a sparse tensor of large dimension could be represented as a single strided matrix, which can make CVXPY backend operations orders of magnitude more efficient.",

However, there are still many useful improvements can be made. This proposal suggests improving the spopt package by implementing the P-Median model with Near-Far Cost Allocation. In the article by Church (2018), it proposed a new p-median model which can distinguish between near and far facilities, use both explicit and implicit variables for capacity allocations. Based on that, the writer plans to implement the p-median model with near-far cost allocation. By this, the spopt package can provide more accurate and efficient solutions to spatial optimization problems, typically for the problems with large data points, and large demand volume. This proposal will introduce the reason why the writer chooses this project, the technical details of this project, and the plan and delivery schedules.",

Users have requested parallel implementations of many algorithms, something especially relevant with the rising interest in machine learning and, as a result, parallel computation. As such, I built the foundation for nx_parallel, a parallel backend to NetworkX that makes use of its plugin dispatch architecture, an experimental feature. I parallelized multiple NetworkX functions in nx_parallel, and created the structure for future efforts to build out the parallel backend. \nIn addition, although the graph algorithms in NetworkX are well-documented, users benefit from explanations and example uses of the algorithms. To satisfy this need, NetworkX has created nx-guides, which are pedagogical Jupyter Notebooks that clearly explain and experimentally explore (with examples) algorithms implemented in NetworkX. I added a notebook to nx-guides where I explain the traversal algorithms provided by NetworkX. In addition, new contributors currently do not have a roadmap for contributing to nx-guides, as mentioned by @MridulS in community meeting notes. In addition to my pedagogical notebooks, I finalized an easy-to-follow contributing guide for nx-guides.",

          "abstract_html": "A very interesting and nice thing during the development of batteries are back-of-the-envelope estimations. An example might be to estimate an areal loading of active material necessary to compete with another active material, which has different capacity and potential. The different loading would also influence the entire cell and process design such that a coupled cell-process-cost model could give much more accurate and holistic cost estimates than single rules of thumb can. The coupling of cell and process can be achieved by decomposing the process into decoupled process units, which are then connected with cell parameters, e.g. areal loadings. The flexible submodel structure of PyBaMM would enable the use of independent “plug and play” economics e.g. for modeling different processes and economies of scale, as well as the combination of other PyBaMM models to estimate key values for degradation and thermal performance. Making it possible e.g. to study the interplay between formation and degradation accompanied with costs and other key values such as energy densities.",

However, using QuTiP requires writing Python code, which may present an obstacle in some teaching contexts. Programming is, of course, a very valuable skill to master. Attempting to master it while simultaneously coming to grips with quantum mechanics is perhaps less advisable.\n\nWe would like to create a graphical virtual laboratory powered by QuTiP which allows users to explore quantum systems without being distracted by the need to write software.\n\nThe virtual lab would allow building up experiments from components (e.g. sub-spaces such as qubits, Hamiltonians for those subspaces, interaction Hamiltonians, environment baths), evolving the system over time, applying measurements, and attaching monitoring of quantum states or measurement outcomes (e.g. Hinton plots, Bloch sphere plots). \n\nDeliverables\n\n- A graphical interface that acts as a virtual laboratory\n- Allows the construction of simple quantum systems (e.g. placing four neutral atoms)\n- Allows defining the evolution of each system component\n- Allows defining the interactions between system components\n- Allows coupling the system to an environment bath\n- Allows simulating the system dynamics and visualizing their evolution over time\n- Allows visualizing the steady state of the defined system\n- Can be run on both desktop and tablets",

BYM is a highly flexible model for studying spatial data and is used widely in epidemiology, agriculture, and ecology. The strategy behind the BYM model is to treat the outcome of interest as the result of three factors: some set of predictor variables, spatial covariance between neighboring regions, and random effects that represent non-spatial heterogeneity.\n\nAlthough very flexible, the BYM model can be difficult to specify in a way that is simultaneously computationally efficient, interpretable, and identifiable. Recently, Morris et al (2019) demonstrated an alternative specification of the BYM model that is significantly more efficient, interpretable, and can be identified with Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) samplers.\n\nDeveloping an implementation in Python with PyMC would make the model more accessible to a greater variety of users. Furthermore, BYM models are only available in a Bayesian framework. As a leading Bayesian statistics package, PyMC should support this extremely useful model in spatial statistics.",

Since it does not require gradients, it can efficiently optimize hyper parameters for a Deep neural network or even electronic structure methods without derivatives. The project involves using Bayesian Optimization with an active learning approach to optimize conformers. The major work involves finding the right set of kernels for the Gaussian Process model for different types of molecular variables like Vibrational energy, bond lengths etc. and tuning them. We also an active learning approach to help the algorithm converge towards the solution much more quickly. Finally, we benchmark and compare the performance of our optimizer against other conformer optimization methods in use, like BFGS and gradient-based optimization algorithms.\n\nThis project has the potential to significantly improve the optimization capabilities of researchers in several fields by reducing the cost of optimization and improving optimization performance. The ALBGO algorithm will be a valuable addition to the optimization landscape, and its PyTorch-based implementation will make it easily accessible to a wide range of users including non-chemists.",

Our main goal is to promote Openness.\nGFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance  is a platform for Open Standards, Free Software, Open Content, Open Data & Open Hardware in Greece. The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advises on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e.g. https://howto.gov.gr/ - https://forma.gov.gr/) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (https://openedtech.ellak.gr/ )",

It aims to solve the problem of manual intent example creation in virtual assistant development. VAs require a set of examples of user intents to understand and respond to user queries correctly. However, manually creating these examples can be time consuming and vulnerable to errors, so the project has two objectives: 1. Develop a M2M transformation tool that can automatically generate intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions. 2. Automate the creation of intent examples from OpenAPI descriptions directly in the dflow platform. By achieving these objectives, dflow can make the VA development process much easier, saving time and effort for developers. The deliverables of this project include a functional M2M transformation tool and an automated intent example creation feature in the dflow platform.",

      "description_html": "OpenAstronomy is a collaboration between open source astronomy and astrophysics projects that are used by researchers and engineers around the world to study our universe either by analysing the data obtained from amazing instruments like the [James Webb Space telescope](https://jwst.nasa.gov/), the [Square Kilometer Array](https://www.skatelescope.org/) or the [Solar Dynamic Observatory](http://sdo.gsfc.nasa.gov/), developing very sophisticated numerical models (eg. [FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [16 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

          "abstract_html": "RADIS  is a fast line-by-line code for synthesizing and fitting infrared absorption and emission spectra, such as encountered in laboratory plasmas or exoplanet atmospheres. It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. High-temperature spectral calculations require resolving the shape of tens of millions of lines, which is the usual performance bottleneck. RADIS implements a new algorithm to compute these lineshapes and is already one of the fastest line-by-line spectral codes available. It can also compute many different types of spectra (absorption/emission/equilibrium / non-equilibrium). \n\nHowever, although the algorithm is very CPU/GPU efficient, the RADIS code is still memory hungry. Databases are currently loaded in RADIS using the VAEX [3] package, but the operations to calculate the spectra are performed using the PANDAS library. VAEX is a similar table management tool to PANDAS but uses memory mapping, a zero-memory copy policy, and lazy computations for the best performance. \n\n The main goal of the current project is to refactor RADIS so that dataframes are only manipulated via the VAEX format. Potentially, this work would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines (hundreds of GB or terabyte-scale databases).",

X-ray data may not always be evenly spaced. For example when Earth regularly blocks the object of interest as the space telescope orbits the Earth or when the instrument has faults due to system malfunction or cosmic rays hitting the instrument sensors. When the data is evenly spaced, we can use the Fourier domain methods such as power spectrum and cross spectrum in practical time frames to decompose the signal into its various periodic elements. But when the data is unevenly spaced we cannot use the same methods.\n\nLomb Scargle Periodograms and Cross Spectra can be used for analyzing unevenly spaced data. There are various ways to optimize the Lomb Scargle Periodogram's runtime speed such as those introduced by William H. Press and George B. Rybicki.\n\nDeliverables include Lomb Scargle Power Spectrum, Lomb Scargle Cross Spectrum, helper functions(to setup an object with certain inputs for example) and statistical functions(like time lags and phase lags).",

          "abstract_html": "Some of the most extreme and mysterious events in the universe like neutron star mergers, black hole accretions, and gamma-ray bursts are studied by the high energy radiations that they emit. Among all the brightness variations we can study in these sources, periodic and quasi-periodic oscillations are among the most interesting, because they can provide insights into the astrophysical processes in these objects. While the stingray package is a valuable tool for analyzing periodic data, its analysis of quasi-periodic data is limited by biases in frequency domain methods. To mitigate these limitations, a Gaussian process regression (a time domain method) can be used to model the time series for a kernel describing a QPO. Using Bayesian Inferencing, we can infer its parameters and assign them physical meaning related to the physics of the process and perform model selection between QPOs and alternative models. This can be used to reliably detect QPOs, and infer their physical properties. Such methods have already been implemented in recent papers (Huebner et al,2022), and the goal of this project will be to simplify their code and implement it in Stingray using the Tinygp library for the GP backend. It will also be accompanied by a tutorial and a demonstration on various datasets.",

Optical flow is pivotal to many computer vision applications such as object tracking, video stabilization, and motion analysis, providing essential information about the dynamics of a scene or an object. With the upsurge in the use of deep neural networks, DNN models were developed to solve the optical flow problem, achieving state-of-the-art results by learning to estimate motion from image data. However, DNNs can become computationally expensive making it infeasible to be deployed on embedded systems. This problem is tackled by the development of lightweight DNN models. However, OpenCV model zoo hasn't had any implementation of an optical flow lightweight model yet. Thus, this project aims to find the best lightweight optical flow model in terms of model size, speed, and accuracy to introduce to the OpenCV model zoo.",

The tutorial will cover fundamental and advanced concepts related to G-API, such as defining and executing graphs, developing custom operations and kernels, and utilizing numpy inter-op. The anticipated result is a series of new tutorial chapters integrated into the OpenCV documentation, ideally structured in a similar format to the existing documentation. This tutorial will enable users to leverage the power of G-API more effectively, along with optimized image processing tasks and improved performance.\n\n\nThe G-API framework, developed by OpenCVQ, is designed to streamline image processing algorithm flow. Its primary objective is to create graphs that can support multiple backends, resulting in lightweight and fast image processing tasks. For instance, when running the algorithm flow on a GPU, optimized video memory access can reduce system overhead and enhance computational speed. To use G-API effectively, it is essential to (1) understand the framework's overall architecture and features, (2) compare its processing algorithms to those of other common frameworks, identify the unique benefits of each G-API function, and (3) combine these advantages and new features to enhance existing tutorials.",

The end result will be a fully functioning data processing pipeline that is well integrated with the NeRF model training procedure, as well as online documentation that detail how to use the pipelines properly. There are 3 key deliverables for this project.\n\nFirst, implement data loaders that can process user-taken images of real-world scenes. This will involve using the COLMAP and OpenCV data processing pipelines in order to extract the camera poses and epipolar geometry of the scene; these are requirements for the model's ability to learn a meaningful representation of the given scene.\n\nSecond, build, train, and test the actual NeRF model. This will involve using PyTorch's built-in CUDA support and extensive usage of the PyTorch library as a whole in order to incorporate critical components of the NeRF architecture such as positional encoding, ray sampling, and regularization into our model design. This step will also include rendering procedures that will allow users to extract images/videos, depth maps, and other logging information such as the training loss curve from the fully trained model.\n\nThird, create simple and intuitive documentation on how to use both the data loaders and the NeRF code base. This will involve creating a page on OpenCV's documentation (via Doxygen) that will list out specific terminal commands that the user should use to train the model. It will also include a summary of required packages, recommended environment configurations, and links to other helpful resources such as YouTube video demonstrations, which will all be geared towards increasing the usability and accessibility of the pipeline.",

Although Existing realtime object tracking models could reach high speeds on edge devices, their performance is poor. Consequently, the high-performance tracker with fast speed on edge devices is critical. I have two plans to solve this problem. The first Scheme is to use the pre-trained lightweight transformer as the tracking models' backbone and through the proper design, the tracking model not only has good performance because of the use of the pre-trained visual transformer but also because the visual transformer used is lightweight and does not slow down the model due to the huge amount of computation caused by the transformer. The second Scheme is to build a small tracking model and pre-train the small tracking model using the MAE pre-training method, and finally, choose the current best-performing transformer-based tracking model as the teacher model to train the student model. Eventually, two state-of-the-art real-time tracking models will be provided, along with their code, and they will be maintained over time.",

In this proposal, I will address the issue of Japanese Kanji being recognized as Chinese characters, resulting in incorrect locations being returned. Specifically, we will conduct morphological analysis on Japanese searches and perform proper word segmentation at appropriate positions.\n\nThe objectives of this proposal are as follows:\nEnsure that Nominatim does not mistake Japanese searches for Chinese.\nEnsure that Japanese location searches return locations within Japan.\nEnsure that Nominatim correctly identifies the block and house numbers in Japanese addresses, avoiding confusion between the two.",

Our proposed methodology will be implemented and evaluated through a series of experiments designed to measure the effectiveness and usability of the landmark-based navigation system. The results of the project will contribute to our understanding of how landmarks can be utilized in route guidance systems, and hopefully lead to improvements in daily navigations. \n\n\nOur deliverables include new data structures for landmarks, a detailed design of database and storage, an update on existing and new components, ideally a design of new landmark enabled phrases, an improvement of direction generation process, information serialization for json responses, and an evaluation report on the effectiveness and usability of the landmark-based navigation system, etc.",

To begin with I'll have to implement a feature that allows kanidm to store ECDH keys for its users,  as they are required for the Identity verification system to authenticate subjects. Afterwards I will work on the core server-side logic of the system, and finally, if time will allow it, I am going to implement a frontend interface in the kanidm client for the identity verification system.

We realized that and created OpenVINO – an open-source toolkit for bringing AI models to life on the most widespread and available platforms like x86 CPUs, but also Intel GPUs and NPUs that make up an AI PC. One can use OpenVINO to optimize own model for high performance with the most advanced model optimization capabilities and run those through OpenVINO runtime on various devices. \n\nWe are driven by the idea of making it easy for a regular person to learn and use AI with minimal investments and unlock innovation (such as LLMs and Gen AI) to a broad audience. We allow AI inference on the most widespread and popular platforms and provide pre-trained models, educational and visual demos, image annotation tools, and model training templates to get you up to speed. With good use-case coverage and simple/educational API, OpenVINO is also a toolkit of choice for AI in production by plenty of companies. It is a fully production-ready software solution.",

SparkNLP, one such library widely adopted and used by 16% of enterprise companies(as of Feb 2019), is currently capable of taking advantage of CPU optimization capabilities using Intel-optimized Tensorflow. This coupled with other optimizations already allows it to run machine learning pipelines orders of magnitude faster than legacy libraries. Such a library would benefit from solutions like OpenVINO that offer extensive integrations in the ML ecosystem and even further optimization capabilities for inferring and deploying models on a range of hardware platforms. Exposing the OpenVINO API bindings in Java will allow integration with SparkNLP to enable the above-mentioned capabilities, and furthermore, open up avenues for a large community of developers to benefit from OpenVINO’s rich feature set in the future.",

          "abstract_html": "When tackling the challenge of detecting defects in high-resolution images, we encounter many challenges. One significant problem is the difficulty in training models effectively, primarily due to memory limitations. The process of down-sampling these images to fit within memory capacities leads to the loss of crucial information, which can result in the oversight of small yet significant defects.\n\nTo overcome these issues, we can employ a strategy involving a tiled ensemble mechanism. In this case, images are split into smaller, manageable tiles. Each of these tiles is then processed using a separate model, specifically trained for that tile position. This strategy enhances localization and improves the detection of small anomalies, while also satisfying memory limitations.\n\nAnomalib currently has a basic tiler. However, the advantages of locally-aware models, like Padim, are diminished without the support of a tiled ensemble. To address this problem, we introduce a tiled ensemble implementation that preserves the advantages of local awareness while also enhancing overall performance. \n\nThis approach aims to incorporate Anomalib's existing features, while simultaneously providing users the flexibility to tailor specific steps within our pipeline. All the while, we ensure that our approach remains memory-efficient.",

I will evaluate the performance of these optimized models on different hardware platforms and compare them with the baseline models. The deliverables for this project include optimized Timm models, a tutorial notebook detailing the setup and usage of OpenVINO and NNCF libraries, and documentation and tests for the code developed during the project.

We envision a world where access to high-quality education is not a privilege but a human right. \n\nThe team works on two platforms: \n\n    (a) Oppia Web, which provides an online learning tool that enables anyone to learn from effective and engaging interactive lessons (called 'explorations'), which simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor. This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation.\n\n    (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. \n\nAs a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.",

The new design will include a table view of all contributors, with important statistics such as the number of translations, questions submitted, and reviews performed. Each row in the table will represent a contributor and will be interactive, allowing the admin to modify their contribution rights as necessary. This revamp will enhance the functionality and usability of the contributor dashboard for administrators. This is an internal portal so it will be used by language and questions admins as well as super admin. The technical part includes making storage schema to store the newly curated stats, writing Apache-beam Jobs to do big Data operations to handle existing data, making controller level changes, building the frontend with angular, unit testing for frontend as well as backend, e2e tests for frontend.",

My suggested method involves two-fold approach.\n\nI'll start by addressing the accessibility issues (a11y) that have already been reported on the site. This will entail addressing difficulties with heading-related issues, focus management, colour contrast, and more. Many of these a11y issues have contributors associated to them. While I resolve the unassigned problems, I will be available to help any contributors who get stuck or require further support.\n\n\nSecond, I'll utilise Lighthouse to evaluate every Oppia page that is intended for students, raising their accessibility scores to a perfect 100. Each learner-facing page's Lighthouse test audits will need to be examined in order to make the necessary changes. This will include adding alternative text for images, making sure header tags have the right semantic structure, and making sure aria-roles are contained by the appropriate parent.\n\nAlso, in order to aid contributors in understanding the Lighthouse audit procedure and troubleshooting any potential problems that may emerge throughout testing, I will be adding guidance on how to debug Lighthouse tests to the Oppia documentation.",

WPS Interface Standard provides rules for standardizing how inputs and outputs (requests and responses) for geospatial processing services (eg. polygon overlay).

The async tests are still wrong currently and should be fixed, this will be done during the GSoC. The next and final step will be to get the WPS 1.0.0 test suite working and comprehensive enough to get the Test Suite or the ZOO-Project fixed. Moving from OGC API - Processes - Part 1: Core to WPS 2.0.0. can also be added as second step for the project.",

          "abstract_html": "Rate limiting is a technique used by computer systems to control the rate of traffic sent or received by a particular entity (such as an application or a user). The goal of rate limiting is to prevent a single entity from overwhelming the system with too many requests at once causing resource exhaustion, security vulnerabilities, API abuse, and unpredictable behavior. \nThe objective is to develop a plugin for Coraza WAF  which prevents ‘rate-based attacks’ and provides more security and stability to the applications behind the wall. In brief, this is to be accomplished by creating a new directive `SecRateLimitOptions` for specifying the rate limit options(no. of requests allowed per minute, the algorithm used, when to clear rate limit, default action if rate limit exceeds) and a new non-disruptive action `rate limit` which enforces rate-limit on the matching chains of SecRule. A more detailed explanation can be found in the proposal PDF.\nThe set of deliverables, in the end, would be the plugin itself, support for distributed systems, and well-written documentation with examples, benchmarks, and recommended settings.",

More specifically, people take different approaches to examine the performance, such as stability tests (e.g., the peak of I/O, speed of re-connection) and capacity tests (e.g., use of disks). However, individuals often miss measuring before/after using the Firewall.\n\nSecondly, although there are many open-source utilities (e.g., Apache JMeter, httperf), no specific tool is designed to evaluate performance affected by a firewall.\n\nTo address the issue, I suggest creating a CLI tool to benchmark the performance with CRS.\n\n\nA list of deliverables includes:\n\n1) Define a framework for testing performance for a generic WAF.\n2) Research existing utilities for performance testing on WAF.\n3) Create a CLI tool to achieve the framework and define different types of testing performed by the tool.\n4) Implement different types of performance testing.\n5) Integrate the CLI tool with pipelines (e.g., GitHub pipeline).\n6) Based on the existing Docker images, perform different evaluations with different configurations/versions.\n7) Documentation.",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.",

An added long term goal would be to document testing approaches to make adding tests more smooth and consistent across packages for future packages or functions that get on-boarded, thereby making them more maintainable and reliable.",

WebAuthn uses public key cryptography to store user credentials, which makes it more secure than traditional password-based authentication methods. However, the proposal also discusses the challenges of using WebAuthn, such as the Scenario where the authenticator device is not available or lost. The proposed solutions include backup codes, recovery codes, and administrator reset, but all of them require storing some kind of secret on the server, which is a security concern. The proposal suggests alternative solutions like encouraging users to use at least two different Authenticating devices to register.",

In addition, I have included a dedicated section that intricately guides the process of extending PostgreSQL through the incorporation of Functions, Data Types, and Operators. The tutorial will be a quick start guide with clear examples, making it easy for new contributors to understand and follow along. The deliverables of this project will be the tutorial itself, along with any necessary code examples and documentation updates. This project will be valuable for the Postgres community by making it easier for new contributors to get involved and contribute to the extension ecosystem.",

The suite utilizes the amazing abilities of Django Framework and Selenium  webdriver to generate easy to work with logs.\nThe testing suite is designed to test all aspects of the website, including the user interface, the database, and the back-end code. It uses a variety of techniques to test the website, including unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. The testing suite is also designed to be extensible, so that it can be easily updated to test new features and changes to the website.",

The main problem being solved is the difficulty in identifying and resolving common and custom linting errors in AsyncAPI documents. By leveraging the VSCode API for providing quick/autofixes for linting errors, my proposal plans to add an \"Auto Fix\" feature for most common and standard Spectral linting errors in AsyncAPI documents.\n\nThe proposed deliverables for this project include:\n-Integration of AsyncAPI-Preview and Spectral for VSCode extensions\n-Implementation of Code Actions for standard Spectral linting errors in AsyncAPI documents\n-Support for computing json-path to source code and vice versa\n-Investigation on loading autofix rules from external files to support custom (non-standard) Spectral linting rules\n\nOverall, this project aims to streamline the AsyncAPI-Preview process and improve the quality of AsyncAPI documents by providing developers with a more user-friendly and efficient way to identify and fix common and custom linting errors.",

Implementing the JSON Schema specification(s) in a fully compliant way is not without challenge, meaning as a user of JSON Schema it is important to understand how a particular implementation may deviate such that one can make constructive tooling choices or help implementations improve. Bowtie is a recently created tool to aide in this task, helping to surface the conformance of various JSON Schema tools with the specification by running them against a set of known correct test cases and regularly rendering the results to a web page. But it can do more!\n\nExpected Outcomes:\nEnhance (or replace) Bowtie's simplistic current UI so that it most easily answers \"what do various implementations say about each test case\" -- making it snappier and more featureful\nAdd support for further JSON Schema implementations by creating Bowtie harnesses in additional languages\nTeach Bowtie to compare not only True/False validation results but also the full JSON Schema standardized output formats",

The error messages should convey the severity of the error and in beginner friendly language, explain the cause of the error. The error message should also provide links to relevant documentation to contextualize the issues and also include the original JVM message.

It has an HTML5 frontend. It also has realtime DSP backend written in C which can run natively or in the browser.\n\nPurr Data has a special emphasis on generating audio and/or video in real time, with low latency. Much of its design focuses on receiving, manipulating, and delivering high-quality audio signals. Specifically, the software addresses the problem of how to do this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like macOS, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.\n\nPurr Data can easily work over local and remote networks. It can be used to integrate wearable technology, motor systems, lighting rigs, and other equipment. Purr Data is also suitable for learning basic multimedia processing and visual programming methods, as well as for realizing complex systems for large-scale projects.",

          "abstract_html": "My proposed project aims to enhance the Borg ecosystem by tackling three main areas: Filter option in diff and extract view in Vorta, implement live binary tests in Vorta, and bootstrap a Borgmatic restore from nothing. These improvements will help users more efficiently and effectively manage their backups, improve testing processes, and facilitate disaster recovery.\n\nFirstly, I will implement a search function that allows users to filter files by search string in Vorta's diff and extract view. I will also add the \"Change\" filter to the comparison view, which will filter only removed, added, and modified files. This task also includes adding syntax to allow advanced filtering and filter by size range as a stretch goal. These enhancements will help users easily find and manage their backup files.\n\nSecondly, I will improve BorgBackup testing by implementing live binary tests in Vorta. Currently Vorta contains stdout and stderr mock files for the Borg JSON output of various commands for testing purposes but there’s no actual running of the commands. Moreover, it only supports one mock file while Vorta supports multiple Borg versions where output syntax may vary.\n\nThis project aims to improve Vorta Testing by implementing live binary tests that run on multiple actual Borg versions/binaries. I'll also integrate live binary tests with Vorta's CI/CD pipeline. \n\nFinally, I will implement bootstrap functionality in Borgmatic to restore backups from nothing, enabling users to easily recover their data in the event of a disaster. I will implement this feature by providing clear and comprehensive documentation, which will outline the steps required to perform a Borgmatic restore from scratch. This will significantly improve disaster recovery capabilities and reduce the risk of data loss.",

Currently, the GUI only offers a basic set of navigation elements for selecting a file and returns the fs URL for accessing it. The goal of this project is to modernize the GUI using the Pyfilesystem module to make it more user-friendly and efficient.\nPyfilesystem is a Python module used for accessing different types of file systems. It provides a common API for working with various file systems, such as local, remote, and cloud-based storage systems. The Pyfilesystem module is easy to use and has many features that can be used to improve the functionality of the fs_filepicker.\n\nView Layout and Restoring::\nThe mscolab project is a collaborative software platform that enables multiple users to work together on a shared project in real-time. The project is written in Python and uses the PyQT GUI library for the user interface. Currently, the PyQT Gui of the MSS client can handle different views by one flight path. However, once a new flight path is loaded and activated, all views change to this flight path. This is inconvenient for users who want to work on multiple flight paths simultaneously. Additionally, the view configuration consists of many windows with a complex set of configuration options that are tedious to re-create after shutting down the application.\nThis proposal aims to improve the mscolab user interface by adding the ability to store and restore the view configuration of multiple windows for the user. Additionally, the proposal seeks to add a layout option for any participant on the same flight path, as well as the ability for the creator of an operation to set the layout of all participants.",

The following is a brief outline of each project problem, solution, and set of deliverables:\n\nProject 1) Improving Test Coverage\n\nProblem: Vorta has a current test code coverage of 72%, and we would like to get this in the 80% - 85% range. Additionally, current testing files need more a consistent file structure and organization.\n\nSolution: Work with organization mentors to prioritize test code coverage. Create unit and integration tests to reach our target code coverage. Reorganize and restructure testing file.\n\nDeliverables: At least 80% code coverage, with a stretch goal of 85%. Test files separated into unit tests vs integration tests. Consistency in file naming and structure across all test files.\n\nProject 2) Implement Profile Sidebar\n\nProblem: The current profile selector and setting tab implementation mixes global setting with profile specific settings. \n\nSolution: Move the profile selector and settings button to a collapsible sidebar. The settings button opens a new interface with options relating to global settings and profile management, while the individual profile buttons open to profile specific settings.\n\nDeliverables: A new sidebar with profile selector and setting button, as well as a new setting interface. Unit and integration testing accompanying all new features.\n\nProject 3: Test on Live Borg Binary\n\nProblem: Currently we test on static mock files of Borg JSON output. This task would improve testing to run on actual Borg versions/binaries.\n\nSolution: Test multiple versions of Borg using Tox to simplify testing. Implement these changes in setup.cfg\n\nDeliverables: CICD running tests on live Borg binaries with > 99% success rate. Include the option to run existing integration tests locally. Include thorough documentation of this process.",

          "abstract_html": "There is currently no robust and unified sparse ndarray library that is compliant with the numpy API. This prevents the substitution of sparse arrays for dense arrays when needed in many data science workflows. PyData/Sparse is a repository that presents an opportunity to address these issues. In order to do so, there needs to be a C++ implementation of a code-generation algorithm that can generate efficient code for any type of sparse tensor operation. This abstraction allows one to maintain a relatively small piece of code that enables functionality for an exponential number of different sparse array format operations. The main objective of the project is to implement, test and document the merge lattice and its related data structures and algorithms that are vital for code-generation. This will result in a generalizable code-generation algorithm that can be applied for implementing a variety of different sparse ndarray formats that work together. This will involve interfacing heavily with the existing C++ code and its implemented templates to add functionality that constructs and manipulates a merge lattice, which is a useful abstraction in code-generation for sparse tensor algebra operations. As a few stretch goals, I plan on: i) implementing abstractions of what a sparse array is and what operations can be done that leverage this underlying core API, ii) finishing the co-iteration algorithm to account for non-unique and non-ordered levels and iii) begin work on the actual code-generation algorithm that leverages the merge lattice.",

The project will use the bitinformation framework to distinguish between real and false information, where real information is defined as the mutual information between adjacent bits. The proposed algorithm will filter out artificial information, which is a consequence of prior compression, from real information, which reflects the underlying signal. The project will involve a theoretical review, test case generation, algorithm development, evaluation, and integration into xbitinfo, a software package that implements the bitinformation framework. The resulting artificial information filter will provide a valuable tool for users who may not have access to high-precision/uncompressed data, and it will enhance the accuracy and reliability of geospatial data analysis. As a participant in the Google Summer of Code, I am excited about the opportunity to work on this project and contribute to the development of an open-source software tool that will benefit the scientific community.",

The runtime operation could use the SymEngine library for LLVM, C and C++ backends. For Python backend, we can simply use SymPy itself.\n\nThe algorithms would be implemented in the ASR code, which would make them independent of any specific frontend. Any frontend that uses the ASR code could then make use of the symbolic algorithms without having to reimplement them. LPython, in this case, would not implement the symbolic algorithms themselves, but would instead parse the syntax used by the SymPy library, which already has a rich set of symbolic algorithms, and use the ASR representation of these expressions to perform various operations. This would allow LPython to have powerful symbolic manipulation capabilities without having to reinvent the wheel.",

Studies of visual perception and attention in particular are increasingly integrating eye-tracking and EEG/MEG devices, in order to gain a better understanding of these processes and their neural correlates. However, the Python community has yet to coalesce around a well-supported package for analyzing eye-tracking signals. \n\nThis project proposes to integrate support for reading, visualizing, and analyzing eye-tracking signals in MNE-Python.  By incorporating the ability to analyze eye-tracking data into MNE-Python, researchers would be able to analyze both neural and eye movement data within the same software environment, making MNE-Python more versatile and useful for a wider range of research questions. Finally, MNE-Python has a large community of developers and users, making it likely that eye-tracking integration will prove useful for many in the scientific Python community.\n\nThis project will focus on building a robust I/O routine for eye-tracking data and developing functions for preprocessing, visualization, and analytical routines that are commonly required in eye-tracking research. This includes the ability to interpolate eye-position data during blinks, produce heatmap plots of eye-position across trials, and estimate the deconvolved pupil response.",

This results in users relying on external tools or code to analyze and visualize their data, which can be time-consuming and require specialized knowledge. Thus, there is a critical gap in the platform's functionality that needs to be addressed.\n\nSolution:\n\nTo address this issue, a web-based user interface will be developed that will provide l an accessible and user-friendly platform for users to interact with and explore their vector data. This tool will allow users to quickly visualize their data, perform exploratory data analysis, and gain insights into their data without relying on external code. Additionally, a web-based interface will be more accessible to a broader range of users, including those without advanced programming or data analysis skills.\n\nDeliverables:\n\nThe proposed project aims to create a user-friendly web application with a comprehensive set of tools for managing and analyzing data. The application will be visually appealing, easy to use, and accessible on multiple devices. Documentation will also be provided to ensure ease of use and further development. The final deliverables will include a functional and deployable web-based UI for Qdrant that addresses the critical gap in the platform's functionality, making it more accessible, user-friendly, and practical for a wider range of users.",

The project is to add them to the master branch, perform testing and debugging of any errors, add them in a series of patches, each should pass the code review guidelines set up by QEMU developers.\n\nThe solution starts by getting a stack trace of the syscalls that the compiler calls when using the blitz build of qemu-bsd-user, then compare them to the ones that succeed when using the master build of the qemu-bsd-user.\n\nHaving done this, now we know which syscall are already added and those that are not.\nNow we proceed to add the missing ones, the project plan is included in the proposal.\nI will be delivering 32 patches to the qemu-devel mailing list, each one corresponding to a missing syscall.",

          "abstract_html": "Virtiofs is a shared file system that lets virtual machines access a directory tree on the host. Unlike existing approaches, it is designed to offer local file system semantics and performance. \n\nCurrently, virtiofsd integrates the sandboxing code and the server code in a single binary. The goal is to extract that code and create an external tool that creates a sandbox environment and runs virtiofsd in it. This will make it easier to develop sandboxing features and virtiofsd side by side.\n\nIn addition, that tool should be extended to be able to run virtiofsd in a restricted environment with Landlock. Landlock is a Linux kernel module that allows unprivileged processes to restrict their own access rights. This will enable the tool to apply access restrictions to virtiofsd without requiring privileged access, in a way that is enforced by the kernel, thereby increasing the protection of virtiofsd users.\n\nThis will allow greater flexibility when integrating virtiofsd into a VMM or running it inside a container, due to how Landlock enforces access restriction rules as composable security layers that are compatible with system access controls.",

R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.\n\nR is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

In July, my next task will be to add a feature to the \"youdrawit\" tool that will automatically set up scales based on the range of the provided data. This function will analyze the data and determine minimum and maximum values for each axis to set up the axes' scales. In August, to improve the user experience of the \"You Draw It\" tool, I will add tool tips to the shiny applet that will explain tasks and help educate users on using the tool. If I can complete these tasks during the 3-month timeline and have enough time, I will move on to the two additional optional tasks. Then, I will finalize all vignettes, documentation, and tests.",

More examples of how to write complicated simulation and analysis methods will help beginners, and they will be able to use the models in their projects directly. Importing simulated chains from other libraries will help the experienced users perform transfer learning on their Simulated Markov Chains. This tool provides a range of MCMC algorithms and diagnostic tools to help users evaluate the performance of their models. As the Package is Partially developed, I need to implement six significant tasks to complete this package(Reference - Project webpage).

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen works in AI, Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.\n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nSee our Ideas Page for GSoC2024. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

It is witnessed in recent studies how minor verbal tweaks can lead individuals to believe\na certain community being socially distant and indifferent, making it necessary to detect the underlying bias if any, among news stories. This proposal focuses on developing a stance detection pipeline for television news stories incorporating all three modalities i.e. video feed, speech utterances and transcripts. The focus\nis on capturing global characteristics of each modality and then passing them simultaneously through a multi-modal setting including a series of Multi-modal Transformers to induce cross-modal attention across distinct modalities to generate a generic feature representation. These feature representations will be employed to train a classification head to output the stance of a news story.",

Expressing different concepts such as time, place, and emotion comes with speech and some movements called body gestures. The aim of this project is to detect these commonly occurring phrase and gesture combinations to get meaningful patterns and insights. For this, I propose a multi-modal multi-phase pipeline that captures different patterns of body gestures and speech phrases aligned with an articulated time. The three-stage pipeline begins with pose feature extraction in which both supervised\nand unsupervised approaches shall be incorporated to classify and cluster various gesture classes. In the next stage phrase features are extracted. These extracted features are then passed through the next stage. This stage will produce a synchronized dataset by aligning extracted features in time by applying late fusion. Lastly, Apriori Algorithm is applied to identify the frequent phrase and gesture combinations. Further, the project can be merged into production in a Red Hen pipeline.",

The new version includes several features to accelerate the development process and make it more visual.\n\n\nThe first feature is the addition of an example section, which includes a collection of templates that can be used as a starting point for app development. This will save time and effort for developers who are new to app development and help them get started quickly.\n\n\nThe second feature is the implementation of a project concept where multiple screens can be grouped, saved, and revisited at a later time. This will enable developers to work on different parts of the app separately and easily switch between them.\n\n\nThe third feature is the use of the flow concept from https://reactflow.dev. This will allow each project to be represented as a flow, with each screen represented by a block. Actions can be connected to other blocks to visualise the app's lifecycle. This will make the development process more visual and easier to understand.\n\n\nThe last feature is the ability to \"compile the flow\" and run it as a demo. This will allow developers to quickly present a mock or app to validate its usefulness. This will save time and effort for developers who want to get feedback on their app quickly.\n\n\nOverall, Playground 2.0 is an app development platform that makes the development process faster, more visual, and easier to understand. It includes several features that will help developers create custom apps and integrations quickly and efficiently.",

Through the ability of managing user’s boards and making rooms with members as assignees of a board and/or as members of a team, it would ameliorate user experience, as it would allow them to quickly view/update/share their boards with other channel members without even leaving the channel let alone the browser tab.\n\nThe provides 10x more value than what our competitor's Miro app offer for their platform.\nWe will give users ability to preview boards and embed boards in channels using Miro's live embed and give the feature of dynamic modal rendering specific to board items.",

          "abstract_html": "Ruby uses garbage collection (GC) to automatically reclaim memory that was allocated by a program, but no longer used. Consequently, users do not have to manually manage memory, and can more easily avoid memory management issues such as memory leak. However, the program being executed must be stopped for the GC to run. Therefore the efficiency of the GC algorithm will affect the performance of the program.\n\nThe project’s goal is to reduce the cost of GC when there are multiple fibers. Fibers are a memory efficient way to implement cooperative concurrency. Programmers control scheduling of the fiber instead of the operating system, making it possible to better allocate CPU resources. Ruby 3.0, released in 2020, added a Fiber Scheduler, which enables asynchronous behaviour in programs. Ruby’s GC scans through a program’s memory at various points during its execution, identifies which objects are no longer used, and removes them using an incremental tri-color mark and sweep algorithm and generational garbage collection. Improving the GC cost when there are many fibers will enhance the performance of Ruby programs, particularly asynchronous Ruby programs making use of fibers.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Reproducible test that triggers GC for fibers\n2. Identification of GC bottlenecks for fibers\n3. Reduction of bottlenecks compared to benchmark test through improvements to GC\n4.

      "description_html": "Mathematicians, scientists, researchers, and students need a powerful tool for their work or study. SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

However, several aspects make the integration of these libraries not yet fully satisfactory. For example, working over a prime field with a prime below about 20 bits, the mere creation of a zero matrix in SageMath takes roughly as long as the call of the underlying fast reduced echelon form procedure (performed by LinBox / FFLAS-FFPACK in this case). Still about FFLAS-FFPACK: several available tools in this library are not offered through the Sage interface, constraining the user experience; for example, some pivoting strategies are not available, despite their usefulness in some situations e.g. when one is interested in the preservation of some rank profile properties. Finally, the integration of linear algebra implementations from Flint has been initiated, with a good amount of work already done, but is not fully finalized and has not been merged into Sage. This project aims to make this kind of enhancements, which would lead to more efficient and more versatile finite field linear algebra operations in Sage.",

Some steps of these will be iterated over and over to achieve consensus and approval under peer review until finalized.  \n\nIn general, we hope that the implementations of this coding project will empower more advanced research and applications regarding optimization and solver interface integration.

The API should be flexible and extensible, allowing users to easily add new types of plots, customize the appearance and layout, and apply different data transformations. To achieve these goals, we will use the tagless final style and composition, which enables us to combine multiple interfaces.\n2) Graph Adjustments Support: these features can help improve the clarity and usefulness of the plots and graphs we create. These features include axis limits, line width, marker style, transparency, color scheme, legends, annotations, axis scale, aspect ratio, etc.\n3) Documentation: in addition to written documentation, we will provide visual examples and demos that are extremely helpful in illustrating how to use the API.

Scala 3 supports a powerful yet type-safe macro system that allows analysis of the structure of code fragments via quote pattern matching.\n\nIn this project, we aim for two goals:\n1. The current implementation of quote pattern matching does not have many tests and is expected to be unstable. I propose making the feature more reliable by creating a checklist that captures which language features should be supported and adding more automated tests based on the checklist.\n2. The current quote pattern matching does not support extraction of polymorphic functions. I propose extending HOAS patterns to support pattern matching against polymorphic functions based on formal\ndefinitions.",

          "abstract_html": "The current state of the asynchronous I/O on the JVM involves using separate selector threads to manage I/O events through system functions like epoll or kqueue. Although frameworks like Netty and NIO2 make this approach seem reasonable, the use of separate event loop threads is not without cost. In high-RPS services, these threads can compete for CPU time with worker threads executing application tasks, leading to resource contention and potentially significant performance loss. In contrast, Cats Effect offers a different threading model, integrating I/O and application tasks into a single runtime system, reducing contention an enhancing overall efficiency.\n\nio_uring, the key component of this project, offers two major advantages: (1) it enables all supported syscalls to become asynchronous from the application’s perspective, allowing for multiple syscalls to be initiated in parallel without blocking the calling thread, and (2) it uses a pair of ring buffers for syscall submission and completion events that are shared between the application and the kernel, dramatically reducing the overhead of calling from userspace into kernelspace. When integrated with Cats Effect, io_uring can significantly improve the efficiency of syscalls, requiring fewer calls into kernelspace during the worker loop. \n\nThis proposal brings two key innovations together: a new threading model and a new I/O API. By integrating Cats Effects and FS2 with io_uring, we aim to develop an alternative solution to minimize the inefficiencies found in the traditional model, offering a more efficient and performant solution for I/O-intensive applications.",

With the help of zero-shot, few-shot, and fine tuning techniques we could effectively specialize a language model for the use case. Summarization is one such use case that has been widely researched for a couple of years now. Broadly there are techniques such as Abstractive and Extractive approaches. The motive of this project proposal is to handle the summarization task (mostly Abstractive + Extractive hybrid approach) through the language model’s (foundation model) lens. This project aims to cover everything from data collection, EDA, experimenting with different language models to developing production-scale system that can take GitHub repo as reference and provide summary. One of the challenges that is novel is to use smaller sized models to achieve great performance in summarization.\n\nSCoRe Lab has been into developing solutions in the space of making user life easier with products such as D4D, Bassa, Track Pal, and others. This project will add to that portfolio and would be a great reference for AI practitioners and system developers which aims to work right from data to production-grade end product using AI and Systems.",

It is an audio spatialization engine programmed in SuperCollider that can render dense audio scenes to large multi-channel loudspeaker systems in real time. This lower-level audio rendering process maintains a dynamic DSP graph created and controlled via OSC messages from the external process.\n\n\nSATIE can be used not only for sound object control (location, propagation, etc.) but it can also be used for Haptic Floor dedicated to large immersive spaces. In this project, however, we focus on a function of SATIE is that implementing geometry understanding at a spatializer level. In this case, we usually apply the current version of SATIE mappers plugin to perform this function. A mapper plugin does not process audio, it can be used for provide for non-generic control and geometric computation of lower-level spatialization parameters. However, it still has limitations that need to be programmed for each use case. In order to perfect it and improve its efficiency, we need to design and implement the generalizable SATIE mappers that could get all loaded spatializers and set them at a relative distance concerning each other. In other words, it is necessary to make each different spatializer in different positions recognize the relative position of each other. The proposed mappers will be designed to overcome these limitations and will be tested with different spatializer configurations. This project will provide SATIE with a powerful and flexible tool that will enable users to create rich and diverse sound spatial effects in different scenarios.",

It is a space in time where artists respond to the public as much as the public responds to the artists. Also, every person in the audience is surrounded by other people having similar feelings and sensations. \n\nSearching to create related energy and experience via live performances in Extended Reality, this proposal aims to develop a platform prototype to generate a fluid XR experience for users by reliving live performances through motion capture. The key technologies for this goal are: MediaPipe Pose, open source software for pose detection in a live streaming context, and WebXR for the development and hosting of virtual reality and augmented reality experiences on the web.\n\nLive performances have no analog due to their unique energy and feeling of shared experience. XR's experience with concerts and live performances does not necessarily wants to exist as a copy of performances in real-life, but as a proposal of different interactions. Therefore Extended Reality can create its paradigm in art and technology.",

It is able to adapt to virtually any real geometry, as long as the surface is diffuse. Its rendering engine is built using the OpenGL API. It currently runs on platforms capable of running Linux and handling an OpenGL 4.5\ncontext, and has been tested successfully on x86_64 (with NVIDIA, AMD and Intel graphic cards) and aarch64 (with NVIDIA graphic cards).\n\nHowever to be able to: a) optimize it further and b) support more platforms (for example Raspberry Pi), it would be interesting to support more graphics API. To do this it is envisioned to replace direct use of OpenGL with an intermediate, multi-API rendering library.\n\n\n\nWork Done: 1) Investigating available rendering libraries and APIs supported by the Raspberry Pi 4. 2) Modifying Splash's OpenGL 4.5 code to work with OpenGL ES and thus the Raspberry Pi 4. 3) Merging the old OpenGL and the new OpenGL ES codepaths to allow one binary to run both. 4). Pulling out graphics code such that application classes are only responsible for application logic, they just use the provided graphics API specific implementation. 5) Rudamentary performance profiling. 6) Bug fixes to application and graphics code.",

          "abstract_html": "SMT solvers are widely utilized in computer-guided verification of computer programs and artificial intelligence. With a multitude of theories employed in these solvers, it is beneficial to have access to a diverse range of solvers and to minimize the challenge of learning a new API for each of them. Using the solver’s own API directly makes it difficult to switch to another solver without rewriting extensive parts of the application, as there is no standardized binary API for SMT solvers. Also, since these SMT solvers have varying degrees of capabilities and performance and may not accept the same input, frameworks were created, that offer a unified API to several SMT solvers.\nJavaSMT has exactly these attributes, a common API for SMT solvers. The framework provides access to a variety of solvers created using Java and other programming languages. Although most solvers share a common set of supported theories and features, their availability of extra theories and performance may differ. Therefore, the inclusion of additional solvers in the framework is advantageous to its users.\n\nSMT formulas over the real numbers can encode a wide range of problems in theorem proving and formal verification. Such formulas are very hard to solve when nonlinear functions are involved. For that reason, the SMT solver dReal will be implemented in JavaSMT.\nThe SMT solver dReal is a solver that solves nonlinear formulas over the reals. The solver can handle various nonlinear real functions such as polynomials, trigonometric functions, exponential functions, etc. \nThe goal of the project will be to integrate the SMT solver dReal into the JavaSMT framework and to include it in the existing JavaSMT tests.",

          "abstract_html": "SQLancer randomly generates test cases consisting of potentially hundreds or thousands of SQL statements. In order to efficiently identify bugs in these statements, automatic reduction is needed to  systematically remove the bug inducing statements until a minimal bug-triggering test case is derived.\n\nTo improve the efficiency and effectiveness of SQLancer for bug detection and resolution in various DBMSs, I propose to undertake the following tasks:\n\n1. Implement delta-debugging algorithms for statement reduction in SQLancer to improve efficiency and speed.\n2. Define parser-tree transforms to simplify SQL statements. Since SQL syntax varies among DBMSs, generic parser-tree transforms that can be applied across multiple DBMSs will be implemented, such as removing expression nodes or removing certain clauses from the statement.\n3. Generalize statement reduction to additional DBMSs by adding bug reproducers to them.\n\nThe deliverables for this project include:\n\n1. A delta-debugging algorithm that can reduce the bug-inducing statement.\n2. Generic parser-tree transforms that simplify SQL statements.\n3. Support of statement reduction for more DBMSs.",

Nevertheless, there is still room for improvement in data movement operations. Proposal P1144 introduces std::relocate, a feature designed to optimize data relocation by making it safer, faster, and greatly simpler. Essentially, std::relocate utilizes a single memcpy operation to move objects while avoiding unnecessary move-constructor and destructor calls. This improvement impacts key primitives like swap and vector.reserve, subsequently leading to speedup in higher-level algorithms such as rotate and sort.

Despite having many different features and techniques to detect malicious behaviors on a target network, there will always be a problem of processing so much network traffic data quickly and efficiently, both in regards to the CPU and memory usage. However, there is currently no way to gather data about CPU and memory usage during execution time, which makes it difficult to make further performance improvements to the project. Therefore, this project seeks to remedy this by creating a set of tools to gather performance data about the IDS execution behavior.\nTo improve performance data gathering capabilities, the following features will be added to the project:\n- CPU profiling module\n- Memory profiling module\n- Both modules will allow for: Export of profile data, output as both absolute and difference from input profile baseline (if provided), output as data stream\n- CPU/Memory data visualization/analysis module which can: Show process resource usage over time, can restrict to top however many if desired, histogram of resource consumption and time spent at consumption level for a single module, and recommendation lists for modules needing optimization, scoring criteria based on highest memory/CPU usage, longest blocking time, and weighted aggregate score.",

Submitty is feature-rich but lacks simplicity for non-technical users navigating the application. The autograding feature of submitty is an important and mature feature allowing instructors to assign points for various checkpoints in the student-submitted code. All the autograding details are contained in a config.json file \nThe autograding configuration is however a little difficult task for non-technical users. They have to make sure that the format is correct and that all the fields are valid, which can be overwhelming. Hence a GUI page can help more people be accustomed to designing their own configuration files. I am willing to introduce some more features in the GUI which will allow richer and greater engagement with the configuration file for the instructors. \n\nAdditional features\n\nAdd test cases automatically for programming/non-programming courses.\nAdd plagiarism check of 2 types: 1) student vs student  2) student vs internet\nVerify if the config file created is valid or not\nAdd a verification process for the input form text field\nEdit an already existing configuration file with the GUI interface.\n\nDeliverables\n\nGUI for technical and non-technical interface\nPlagiarism checker for all categories\nAdditional features implementation (as discussed above) in the GUI \nDocumentation and tutorials for all implemented features",

          "abstract_html": "The Music Blocks v4 project is a complete overhaul of the original Music Blocks project, which was derived from the Turtle Blocks project. The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance.\n\nThe v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance.\n\nThe proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the \"Project Builder\", which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The Project Builder is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus.\n\nBy implementing the Project Builder feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version (v1) and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.",

However, the current design of how the type-checker evaluates key path component types, their relationships to each other, and key path capabilities results in incongruous compiler errors for otherwise valid Swift code.

However, it has several flaws, including sluggish performance and being overly interconnected with the core of SymPy. As a result of its flaws, a new assumption system, the \"new assumptions,\" was proposed about a decade ago. Since then, the community has made slow but incremental progress in transitioning to and improving this new system. One of the main reasons for this change is that the old assumption system doesn't allow for relation assumptions to be expressed. While the new assumption system does support relational assumptions, the current implementation is very limited. My project aims to address this limitation by enabling the new assumption system to make inferences based on equalities and inequalities, such as \"if x > 0, then x must be positive.\"",

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\n\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).

A hard inner boundary in velocity is set from which radiative packets are emitted through the ejecta according to a black-body distribution at a given temperature. Currently, TARDIS can solve for the radiative and inner boundary temperatures as well as dilution factors given a static inner velocity boundary. The precise location of where this inner boundary velocity should be placed is not always obvious and there are a few methods by which one can intelligently select a location based on the properties of the plasma (which are constantly updating over each iteration).\n\nThis project will aim to update the location of the inner boundary velocity based on a set of options for desired properties of the plasma at each iteration. The options include setting the inner boundary velocity according to a given optical depth over all frequencies (either Planck or Rossland mean opacities) or setting the inner boundary according to a desired value for the dilution factors.\n\nThe project can be broken down into the following four deliverables:\n\n- Estimating the inner velocity value based on target values of optical depth and dilution factor\n\n- Integrate the estimation methods into TARDIS base\n\n- Write thorough test cases for all the above changes.\n\n- Make Jupyter notebooks and tutorials demonstrating the feature.\n\n-Thorough documentation of the changes.\n\n- Write a blog about the project.",

With such comparisons, we can learn more about the physical processes occurring and the conditions inside the supernova, including which elements and atomic transitions are dominant. TARDIS tracks the atomic transitions of interacting photons, level populations, etc. allowing the user to interrogate the physical conditions of the supernova. The goal of this project is to build a visual tool to represent this information for the user in Grotrian diagrams, which show different atomic levels of ions and transitions between them. Developing this tool will allow the user to more easily understand the important physical conditions of their supernova model.\n\nA regular Grotrian diagram would only display the overall line interaction for the packets that interact with the ion, but we also want to display how many packets went through each specific transition and the level populations. One way it could be done is to color each arrow to represent quantity of packets (similar to a heatmap) and the thickness of the level platforms denoting the level populations. This project will have the following deliverables:\n\n- Develop an interactive widget which allows the user to look at the Grotrian diagram for specific ions which interacted with photon packets during a TARDIS simulation.\n\n- The widget should allow the user to filter on a wavelength range, type of line interaction (excitation or de-excitation), and ion. The diagram will also give a sense of the frequency of each line transition using colors.\n\n- Develop the above plot as a static Matplotlib too.\n\n- Integrate this widget into TARDIS codebase and documentation.\n\n- Create a Jupyter notebook tutorial for the tool.",

An easy way to accomplish this quickly is to add Numba JIT compilation. Because this can be accomplished so rapidly, a next goal would be to reimplement parts of STARDIS with C/C++ or Cython extensions. This project proposal therefore consists of four implementation phases, the first pair using Numba and the second pair using C/C++ or Cython extensions, with each pair consisting of a CUDA and a Non-CUDA implementation. \n\nI intend to make these improvements incrementally and systematically. I will also benchmark the performance before and after each time I reimplement portions of the STARDIS codebase to both understand how much speed was gained and prioritize what to focus on in each next step.",

Touchless gesture-based intuitive systems can reduce transmission in public settings and workplaces, and offer a seamless and convenient experience.

The app will showcase an augmented transaction panel previewed on the screen, enabling users to perform essential CRUD operations of items through custom simple-to-use gestures, without physical touch. Both custom defined & pre-trained gestures from Mediapipe’s tasks-vision API will be utilized to classify gestures and trigger events on the interface. \n\nThe project targets most platforms, primarily big screens, and may run on selective mobile devices with a camera module for input feed. All data taken via input video feed is deleted after returning inference and is computed directly on the client side, making it GDPR compliant. Once completed, the Web App will be uploaded to Codepen and/or deployed on Vercel.",

ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.\n\nUsers write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.\n\nThe compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.\n\nTo really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.",

This would enable\nmore easily serializing ENIGMA's internal state for use in sending state\neither across a network or into a file.\n\nAdditionally, the project aims to introduce support for the JSON format within the serialization system, offering it as a new option alongside the existing bytes format. This addition enhances the readability and debugging capability of the serialized data.",

Our source code is the foundation for well-known products such as the Sony PlayStation, Junos (the operating system powering Juniper routers), and elements of Apple's macOS. Additionally, FreeBSD runs on servers at Netflix that stream terabits of video content every second.\n\nThe FreeBSD Project has a rich history spanning over 30 years, originating in 1993 but rooted in work from the Berkeley Computer Systems Research Group dating back to 1978.  Over the years, our codebase has undergone continuous development and played an important role in developing essential software components used by numerous open-source projects. Examples include bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.\n\nFreeBSD maintains an active mentoring program to welcome new developers into our vibrant community. With approximately 300 developers with write access to our repositories and numerous other contributors, our community thrives on collaboration and shared expertise. Many of our past Google Summer of Code contributors have transitioned into becoming key members of the FreeBSD development team.\n\nCommunication within the FreeBSD community occurs through various channels, including mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups, all listed on our main website.",

Unfortunately, allocating superpages can often fail due to a high rate of external fragmentation in physical memory. Thus external physical memory fragmentation in modern operating systems has once again become a serious issue.\n\nThis project aims to design and implement several anti-fragmentation mechanisms for the FreeBSD kernel.\nAt the time of writing, the FreeBSD kernel has no memory compaction mechanisms or any way of quantifying physical memory fragmentation.\nThe first major goal is implementing several fragmentation metrics for the page allocation code.\nThe second major goal is designing and implementing a runtime physical memory compaction mechanism.\nWhen invoked, this mechanism would identify sparsely populated\nand fragmented physical memory regions and rearrange the pages to eliminate any \"holes\" in the region. Aside from explicit invocation, a background daemon would monitor\nthe relevant fragmentation metric and trigger the memory compaction mechanism should the value drop below a certain threshold.\nThe last goal will introduce a passive anti-fragmentation mechanism for the demand paging mechanism. The key idea is to enhance the page placement code to\nuse contiguous spans of pages instead of allocating random pages.",

          "abstract_html": "The problem to solve is the implementation of a truly transparent mode on mitmproxy both in OSx and Linux (Issue #1261 unsolved since 2016).\n\nI plan to adapt existing Rust API `start_os_proxy()` and `stop_os_proxy()`, that currently works only on Windows (trough packet_sources/windows.rs), to MacOS and Linux creating new crates `osx.rs` and `linux.rs` that will use properly osx-specific APIs.\n\nIn addition, I will also adapt the existing `--mode osproxy[:pid or executable name] `command-line option to allow users to specify a PID or executable name for the process to be intercepted by mitmproxy.\n\nThere are two possible approaches that can be taken:\n\n1. The first is to use packet filter (pf) for macOS, initially trying to swallow all traffic coming from the same machine that is launching packet filter itself. The second step in this approach will be to use some gimmick to figure out which packets are actually coming from mitmproxy and filter them out to avoid loops, a possible solution for this could be to use nettop, launching it as a command directly from rust, the solution is not definitive and possible alternatives should be explored to understand the privilege issue as well.\n2. A second approach is to use NEAppProxyProvider: an Apple proprietary framework that extends the functionality of the iOS and MacOS network stack. With NEAPP we can implement custom rules for filtering, routing, and modifying network traffic based on a variety of criteria, such as the app, the network protocol, the destination address, or the user identity. As it is a proprietary framework, we need to develop in Swift or objective-C and then transmit the information to the main mitmproxy stack.\n\nHow other proxies or VPN actually work:\n- WireGuard: wireguard has a apple version written in Swift, the adopted approach is the second one, it uses Apple Network Interfaces [ source ]\n- Squid: the same problem is  currently unsolved\n- TinyProxy: it uses  POSIX and no https transparent proxy",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2023 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and National University of Singapore.\n\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

The goal is to develop a user-friendly library that allows researchers and practitioners to easily construct and combine various components for variational approximation of general target distributions, without being tied to specific probabilistic programming frameworks or applications. \nTuring.jl's Bijectors.jl package offers an outstanding interface for working with normalizing flows; our project will build upon the foundation of Bijectors.jl to further enhance its capabilities and applicability. However, the current design of Bijectors.jl has several limitations such as lack of full GPU compatibility, lack of batch support, etc. Thefore, the main tasks of our projects are to address these limitations for Bijectors.jl, as well as developing the variational inference library.",

Same for remote CUPS printers and also Printer Applications . They are all discovered as IPP print services.\nAnd listings of IPP print services have different requirements: One server can have more than one individual print service and these should get listed together. This could be a print queue and a fax out queue of the same multi-function printer, or two physical legacy printers supported by one Printer Application. Also the user interaction coupled to each listing is different. We do not need to configure PPD option settings, but instead, we need access to the IPP service's web administration interface and also to an IPP System Service configuration panel by a simple mouse click.\nSeveral parts of this were already coded in previous GSoCs, but we need to get everything smoothly integrated in the “Printers” part of the GNOME Control Center.

It provides the support to analyze the stacks end to end leading from hardware events such as instructions executed, cache-misses suffered, or branches mispredicted to software events such as CPU-clock, page-faults, task-CPU etc. The linux perf tools help us to point out exactly where the specific event is leading to performance downturn in kernel, BPF or userspace application. The increasing demand for consolidation due to the bloom in fields of AI and the cloud technology requires increased efforts to provide best performance for novel devices. As software systems become increasingly complex, identifying and resolving performance bottlenecks becomes more challenging. In an effort to address this issue, this project seeks to enhance the support for performance data analysis in various formats commonly used by software developers. Specifically, we aim to enable the export of performance data to formats such as Firefox's Gecko profile format and Chrome's trace event format, making it easier for developers to analyze and optimize their code for different platforms and environments. By doing so, we hope to improve the overall performance and user experience of software applications.",

For CUPS, for example, the daemon is started (on an unprivileged port so that it does not need root), queues created and listed, jobs sent, and the logs checked whether everything went OK. For Ghostscript, a large collection of input files (gathered from bug reports) is processed and converted into raster formats.\nThe task here is to write test programs for the different OpenPrinting projects so that `make test` does something useful, efficiently catching regressions. They should exercise important functionality of the software with different parameters and analyze logs and output files to check whether the program did the expected work.\nTest programs are also needed for the so-called 'autopkgtest' tests which are added to Debian packages and executed whenever the package is uploaded to Debian or Ubuntu.\nIn addition, instruction files and shell scripts are needed to build the software on different platforms/environments, run tests, and create GitHub Actions (for the automatic triggering on each commit)",

The goal is to develop a voice assistant that can understand voice commands and take necessary action based on them (e.g. turn down the volume, increase AC temperature).\n\n-- Implementation Details:\n    The current Vosk Kaldi speech-to-text functionality will be enhanced by integrating the Snips and RASA NLU engine. The NLU engine will help in extracting the context and intent of voice commands. The extracted intent will be used directly or indirectly by a gRPC-based service which will execute it by communicating with the underlying Kuksa Server APIs. \n\n-- Deliverables:\n    1.) Integration and development of Snips and RASA Natural Language Understanding Intent Engines with existing Vosk implementation.\n    2.) Ability to execute the intent extracted from the NLU engine using a gRPC-based server, GStreamer, and Kuksa.\n    3.) A flutter-based Linux voice assistant app to communicate with the gRPC-based service.",

Providing the user 24/7 customer chat support using RocketChat\n3. Integrating external payment system, Mojaloop via the Payment Hub. \n4. Covering all the screens with UI tests using Espresso. \nThe proposed enhancements to Mifos Mobile application are expected to have a significant positive impact on the user experience. By replacing the existing API layer with Open Banking APIs, clients will be able to enjoy seamless and more secure transactions. The provision of round-the-clock customer chat support through RocketChat will ensure that users receive prompt assistance whenever they require it. Integration of Mojaloop through the Payment Hub will enhance the application's payment capabilities, and it's reach. Lastly, the coverage of all screens with UI tests using Espresso will improve the overall reliability and robustness of the application, leading to increased user satisfaction.",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008.  The simulator is written in C++, with bindings for Python scripting, and uses the CMake build system.  We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and Zulip chat, but typically not other social media.",

      "description_html": "The Palisadoes Foundation’s open-source software projects support community groups in organizing their daily activities. A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\n\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed.\n\nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\n\nSince 2019 we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also felt these organizations often faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.\n\nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the open source software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site cloud hosted service as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills to do so independently. We hope that our contributors will help us achieve this goal.",

The project will involve refactoring the current codebase, creating interfaces for PolyPhy that enable access to its features through Python/Jupyter code and command line, configuring the codebase according to the team's needs, and improving the performance, security, and documentation of PolyPhy. \n\nTo achieve these goals, I will refactor existing codebase and enhance the PolyPhy package, create a common API to allow multiple and dynamic changes to the pipeline, implement efficient CI/CD workflows for the PolyPhy repository, including unit and integration tests, and create a public pip package release for PolyPhy. Additionally, I will implement a monitoring and logging system to detect and diagnose issues with the software in production, perform profiling and load testing to improve code quality and performance, and establish security best practices such as code reviews, vulnerability scanning, and penetration testing.\n\nThe expected result of this project is a robust and user-friendly PolyPhy package that can handle different parts of the pipeline, has an efficient CI/CD workflow, and adheres to security best practices. The package should be Dockerized, and the build process should be automated using Docker tools, which will help in maintaining consistency across multiple platforms. Moreover, there should be a Github page workflow for the PolyPhy website deployment, and an issues template should be created to promote people from opening issues on the repos. Finally, the documentation should be improved, and a release management process should be established that includes versioning, release notes, and changelogs.",

          "abstract_html": "Scalable systems lay essential foundations of the modern information industry. HPC data centers tend to have hundreds to thousands of nodes in their clusters. The use of “extreme-scale” distributed systems has given birth to a new type of bug: scalability bugs. As its name suggests, scalability bugs may be presented depending on the scale of a run, and thus, symptoms may only be observable in large-scale deployments, but not in small or median deployments. For example, Cassandra-6127 is a scalability bug detected in the popular distributed database Cassandra. The scalability bug causes unnecessary CPU usage, however, the symptom is not observed unless ~1000 nodes are deployed. This demonstrates the main challenge of studying scalability bugs: it is extremely challenging to reproduce without deploying the system at a large scale.\n\nThe project goal is to build a dataset of reproducible scalability bugs. Achieving this will involve analyzing bug reports from popular distributed systems like (e.g., Cassandra, HDFS, Ignite, Kafka) and determining if the reported bug depends on the scale of the run, such as the number of nodes utilized, the size of files, and the number of requests. Identified bugs will be used to build a dataset of bug artifacts that contain the buggy and fixed versions of the scalability system, a runtime environment that ensures reproducibility, and a workload shell script that would trigger some system functionalities and demonstrate the symptoms of the bug under different configurations. For example, a successful reproduction should be able to show the performance drop along with an increasing number of nodes.",

This project seeks to invite and support broader, more diverse participation in open source by supporting early contributors – especially those who have been historically minoritised within tech.\n\nThe project will aim to accomplish the following tasks:\n\nCreating content that anyone with some Open Source experience can use to help and guide other completely new students to the journey of OpenSource, GitHub, and all the relevant technologies. This step would involve creating content in the form of transcripts, markdown guides, blogs, and some video content, which would serve as instruction manuals or workshop notes.\n\nProviding a medium and a platform for all contributors to share their various OpenSource experiences and testimonials. The same can be done in textual or multimedia formats like videos and photographs.\n\nConducting an Open Source Themed Hackathon/Scavenger Hunt: We can organise a simple scavenger hunt for students on GitHub, where they can be provided simple tasks like creating issues and commits!  GitHub workflows are an excellent tool for auto-evaluation of the same. Technical documentation will also be provided on how other users can create their own hunts.\n\nSocial Media Engagement: Social media is where most youngsters are these days. Thus, we should be leveraging the power of the same to get young minds acquainted with the technical and open-source world at a young age so they can consciously choose to explore it further.",

Users can view and rotate the resulting network. A web app, Polyglot, enables users to navigate a map of the network, hover for detailed views of points, and filter sections of the network based on a novel similarity metric. Despite its excellent interactivity, Polyglot is limited to three precomputed networks. We propose to combine the two tools such that a user can upload any of their own networks from PolyPhy and thus greatly increase the ability of users to interact with their networks from PolyPhy.",

Adding a menu to the application:\n\n- Currently, the Scribe application only displays the installation guide and a link to the open-source repository. \n- The design for the menu as seen in the figma file found in the repository of Scribe-iOS suggests the creation of multiple different screens that navigate to sections -- Installation, Settings, About and further sub-sections.\n- We can assume a simple navigation stack where the bottom most layer is the main ViewController. This is achieved using a NavigationController on the first view that is presented.\n\n2. Adding more languages to the application\n\n- The data used by Scribe-iOS is generated and processed in the Scribe-Data project repository.\n- The deliverables here will include generating data for all the planned languages that need to be added to Scribe, cleaning and processing data to obtain language data files, creating and assigning corresponding files and variables in Xcode for all languages and user testing.",

Indeed, X.Org is much broader than just the X Window System. Under the umbrella of the X.Org Foundation can be found Linux's DRM subsystem (10% of the size of Linux), Mesa (open source 3D and video-decoding acceleration for AMD, Intel, NVIDIA,...), and Wayland. X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",
