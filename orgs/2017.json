      "description_html": "<p><a href=\"http://52north.org\" target=\"_blank\">52°North</a> is an international research and development partner network with partners from academia, the public sector and industry. Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, web-based geoprocessing the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.</p>\n<p>Some of our software projects are enviroCar, 52°North SOS, 52°North Helgoland (JavaScript Sensor Web Client), ILWIS, and 52°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Open Hub page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, ConnectinGEO, WaterInnEU, ODIP 2, SeaDataCloud).</p>\n<p>All of the 52°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.</p>\n<p>52°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.</p>\n",

To break this barrier, a REST API can be implemented which will be used by a web interface to make use of VXQuery effectively. Therefore, adding a REST API will add more value to VXQuery and will help VXQuery to reach more users in the future. Implementing the REST API and developing a simple web interface on top of that are the main objectives of this project.

The proposed zookeeper module will minimize the manual configuration required when configuring OODT components. That is, this module will make use of the inherited configuration at component level. For example consider the file manager. Almost all the configurations of file manager instances are identical. Therefore, new file managers which are coming up later will inherit the configuration of the initial file managers and will almost remove the manual configuration required when adding new nodes to the cluster.</p>\n",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a> (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>appleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&amp;D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).</p>\n<p>In October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year.

Optimizing the light sampling algorithm leads to faster and more efficient use of rendering time with the same degree of image realism, which are the exact same reasons why improvement of many-light sampling in Appleseed is required.</p>\n<p>Within the proposal I've given an overview of the implementation approach of the new many-light sampling algorithm, split the overall problem into smaller pieces and tried to propose a realistic implementation timeline.</p>\n",

During my work I will investigate different approaches of visualizing volumes, select the techniques that are modern, efficient and fit the best to the existing path tracing code of appleseed, and then implement the chosen methods. Additionally, I will introduce how users will interact with the newly added features by extending the user interface of appleseed.studio.</p>\n",

Ardupilot rover version (APMRover2) is well behind Arduplane and ArduCopter in capabilities as they attract more attention from developers.  One obvious example is that Rover has only a very basic avoidance system (turn 45° on obstacle). It is also missing some autonomous features (on spot turn etc.), and more significantly is missing a proper motor configuration abstraction layer. While ArduCopter is capable of being configured in 4,6,8 motors copter with brushed (PWM) or brushless motor (RC PWM), the rover version is still limited to two modes: rover with propulsion and a steering servo (normal mode) and tank mode (skid steering mode), with only support on brushless motor.\nMy proposal to this GSOC is split in two parts. Firstly, reduce the gap between the APMRover2 and the other vehicles to provide a good generic UGV platform capable of multiple configurations, with advance feature such as avoidance.  Secondly,  provide a good set of tutorials on the usage of ROS and ardupilot either for single unit control or on simulated unit on Gazebo simulator!</p>\n",

Despite several techniques that try to mitigate this issue (e.g. RPC), a more opaque abstraction layer is needed in order to avoid long implementation times as well as incorrect behaviour driven from faulty or careless code. I believe that providing a programming-language-level abstraction layer is an effective approach to significantly reduce the amount of time focused on how systems can fail, rather than how they should work. Such an approach should mainly consist in supplying systems programmers with basic functionalities in the following areas: node distribution, data replication and partition tolerance.\nBeing in an early adoption stage, Lasp needs applications that can serve as proof of concept in order to increase awareness of its capabilities as well as user adoption. This proposal is about the implementation of a real world application based on previous work published recently at PaPoC'17 - an EuroSys workshop.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>The IDEs of Python</h3>\n<p>Python has proven itself as a highly capable language - approachable for newcomers, but powerful in the hands of experts. The BeeWare Project aims to take the power of Python as a language, and use it to enable users of all skill levels to develop applications with native user interfaces; to do for mobile and desktop user-facing software the same thing that <a href=\"https://djangoproject.com\" target=\"_blank\">Django</a> has done for web software. This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,</li>\n<li>Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Python native</h3>\n<p>If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that.</p>\n<h3>Platform native</h3>\n<p>It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.</p>\n<h3>More than just code</h3>\n<p>We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.</p>\n",

The main goal is the complete port of Cricket to use Toga as the framework for GUI interface. The base logic is mostly complete, so firstly I will plan how to adapt the actual architecture of the view to use Toga widgets. If I find one widget that Cricket uses but isn't implemented on Toga, I will develop a contribution to this specific widget. This way the application will not lose the basics layout. So, the proposal will not only focus on the port of Tkinter to Toga, but on mapping the necessary widgets for a real application using Toga framework. In addition of the advantages of using Toga instead of Tkinter as I highlighted, this is a opportunity to improve error handling and make better use of features that Toga has but Tkinter does not. It will be the first BeeWare project that “eats it is own dogwood\".</p>\n",

In particular, instead of naively focusing on the existence of the topic in the article, techniques with machine learning can broaden the search range by including more relevant secondary keywords in addition to the various variation of the given topic. Meanwhile, methods (such as SVM, nearest neighbor) can also be employed to prune the fetched articles to filter out those are irrelevant to our topic despite containing the exact words on the topic. Furthermore, due to the fact that articles may use different choices of words over time, time series analysis needs to be applied to keep track of the evolution of one topic during a certain period of time. In this project, I plan to design and implement a proof of concept unsupervised machine learning approach to retrieve articles and prune the results, with the assistance of mathematical models.</p>\n",

Gatekeeper is an open source defence against denial-of-service (DoS) attacks. To protect server resources from an attack, it services requests based on priority: the higher its priority, the closer to the exit of the egress queue its placed. Additionally, it also limits the requests’ maximum link bandwidth occupancy to 5%. Such countermeasures are implemented through the priority queue data structure which holds all requests in a single priority queue dropping low-priority requests when resources are low. This functionality allows us to allocate as many resources as possible to high-priority requests while servicing low-priority requests only when resources are idle. The successful implementation of this project will essentially enable a regular Linux router to help isolate and protect legitimate traffic during DoS attacks by employing Gatekeeper’s priority queue as a kernel module, enabled by its userspace component in Linux's tc(8) utility.</p>\n",

Currently, the user has to create a sketch for the rebar profile and define the required set of constraints. This becomes very time-consuming task even for an expert level user when he/she has a building model with several structural objects. This project is aimed at easing up the process of rebaring in FreeCAD. In this project, list of rebars will be provided to user in the form of dropdown. On selecting a rebar from dropdown, a dialog box will popout with input fields where can provide data related to selected rebar. The entire project will be delivered as a FreeCAD addon. The input fields in the dialog box are further categorised and presented in the form of tabs. User can easily switch to any tab to see contained input fields, thus enriching the experience by keeping the natural flow of user. With successful completion of this project, FreeCAD user will have an easy and professional way to create rebars for their projects with less efforts in less time.</p>\n",

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.</p>\n<p>The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.</p>\n<p>We also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 400 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.</p>\n<h3>Who is using cBioPortal?</h3>\n<p>The <a href=\"http://www.cbioportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">public instance of cBioPortal</a> is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 3,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal (<a href=\"http://cancerdiscovery.aacrjournals.org/content/2/5/401.abstract\" target=\"_blank\">Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012</a> &amp; <a href=\"http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23550210\" target=\"_blank\">Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013</a>) have been cited more than 1,900 and 1,400 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe. Notably, cBioPortal has been adopted as the analysis and visualization platform by <a href=\"http://blog.aacr.org/aacr-project-genie-the-sharing-economy-comes-to-the-clinic/\" target=\"_blank\">AACR GENIE</a>, an international multi-institutional data-sharing project to catalyze precision oncology.</p>\n<h3>Who are we?</h3>\n<p>We are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from <a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, <a href=\"http://www.dana-farber.org/\" target=\"_blank\">the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute</a>, <a href=\"http://www.theprincessmargaret.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Princess Margaret Cancer Centre</a>, <a href=\"http://www.chop.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">Children's Hospital of Philadelphia</a>, and <a href=\"http://thehyve.nl/\" target=\"_blank\">The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands</a>.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>A major need in cancer research is the development of non-invasive cancer detection and monitoring methods. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is DNA that has escaped from tumor cells and is free-floating in the bloodstream, meaning that genetic information about the developing tumor can be obtained without the need to invasively extract tumor tissue. cBioPortal wants to display the insights obtained from these “liquid biopsies” onto their existing Patient View page. I propose to create a global view of ctDNA information by modifying their existing Genomic Overview to display allele frequencies, allowing users to identify at a glance mutated genes of interest. Mutated genes can be tracked by clicking on the gene, which would display a plot of the gene’s mutation concentration over time. A heatmap of selected genes can also be generated to monitor tumor heterogeneity over time. Another feature could consist of plots to track whether a mutated gene produces a differential time to relapse or survival time compared to the unaltered gene. By visualizing ctDNA results on the cBioPortal interface, I can participate in adding an exciting new clinician tool for personalized cancer genomics.</p>\n",

It has currently integrated a few resources, including OncoKB, MyCancerGenome, and CancerHotspot.org in the annotation column in the mutation table. In addition to this, it would be useful to link to clinical trials too for each mutation.\nClinical trials are a key research tool for advancing medical knowledge and patient care. They are an important step in discovering new treatments for cancers and other diseases as well as new ways to detect, diagnose, and reduce the risk of disease. Therefore I propose to link clinical trials for cancer studies in CBioPortal which will improve the ability to analyze and interpret the genomic data for various kinds of mutations. Linking clinical trials from Molecular Match for mutations based on a patient’s cancer type and molecular data would the most feasible option for this project since it provides an effective API to retrieve precise data in real time</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Whether it's because you are learning a new language, have hearing problems or just at a loud place, subtitles are an essential part of enjoying TV and movies for a a lot of people. There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. \nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. \nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps.\nWe also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.</p>\n",

They split the input into chunks, and calculate the hash of each chunk using a simple (i.e. fast) hashing algorithm. What is important to note here is that the hash for the whole string is calculated incrementally, beginning from zero (or some known constant value), and for each chunk the checksum of the string including that chunk is calculated only using the old checksum (of the string without the new chunk) and the difference between the last chunk and the current one.</p>\n<p>Some useful rolling hash algorithms that could be employed are Fletcher’s checksum algorithms or the Adler-32 checksum.</p>\n",

Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments have announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: detector and accelerator simulation (Falcon, Geant4, GeantV, Pythia, SixTrack), data analysis (ROOT, TMVA, scikit-HEP, Go-HEP), event reconstruction (CMS Tracking), data management (transfer2go) and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Particle transport Monte Carlo simulations are a key tool for High Energy Physics experiments, including the LHC experiments at CERN. All Monte Carlo (MC) simulations depend vitally on Pseudo-Random Number Generators (PRNGs) used to sample many distributions.\nEach LHC experiments generates 5-10 Billion sampled physics events a year using around 10^18 sampled values from PRNGs. PRNGs take 1-5% of CPU time. PRNGs used must possess very large periods, fast execution, the ability to create a large number of streams, and very good correlation properties between streams and sampled values. It must be possible to reproduce a simulated event any time, for reexamination or debugging.\nThe transition from event-level parallelism in Geant4 to dynamical multithreading in GeantV requires associating the random generator states not with the threads but with the tracks, which are shuffled between \"baskets\" based on their type and energy. Maintaining reproducibility after such transition requires a drastic change in the way the random generators are used. We suggest solutions based on Scalable Pseudo Random Number Generators and on pedigrees introduced in CilkPlus, which are first tested in Geant4.</p>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type\nsystems</a>, and other\npeople have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many\nmore</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds\nof projects at Google, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big\nto small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft\nand the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the\nmotivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have\nreceived multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this\nwidespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:\neverything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE\nintegration.  We welcome your contribution!</p>\n<p>Please see our <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html\" target=\"_blank\">ideas list</a> for <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/gsoc-2017-ideas.html#get-started\" target=\"_blank\">how to get started</a>.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Checker Framework provides a collection of type systems to prevent bugs on Java programs at development time. Although a type system might be useful to prevent certain types of errors, it requires the effort to write all the types, which might be an annoying task for developers. In order to tackle such problem, developers might use a type inference tool to write the types for a program. Particularly, to determine what type should be written for a procedure’s formal parameter, a type inference tool must examine the type of the argument at every call to that procedure. Thus, the type inference process requires a whole-program analysis. In conclusion, the main goal of this project is to create a single type inference tool that will work for any type system available in Checker Framework (e.g., Nullness and Interning Checker).</p>\n",

This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs.</p>\n<p>We have developed the Classical Language Toolkit (CLTK) because we believe it will revolutionize the study of the ancient world. It will do so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500). As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars of tomorrow discover the shared origins of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>\n<p>As software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version–controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre–trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models, Moses for machine translation, and LDA for topic modeling), we now provide (or will soon) easy–to–use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>\n",

For example, a number of Old French texts from the BNF's 19th century editions have been digitized and made available at gallica.fr. \nLemmas will be sourced from Godefroy's 1901 \"Lexique de l'Ancien Français\" and the \"Dictionnaire Electronique de Chrétien de Troyes\", which has the advantage of English-language definitions.</p>\n",

This description focuses on the (3) computational linguistics subgroup.</p>\n<p>Current research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of  personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.</p>\n<p>Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.</p>\n",

A substantial part of this undertaking is to port a majority of the code base to Python 3. This involves porting the individual modules and sub–modules piece by piece, where the whole process will be guided by <em>unit tests</em>. In the beginning, I will remove all tests from the pipeline that do not pass for Python 3 and take this pared–down code base as a starting point, porting parts of the code and putting the respective unit tests back in as I go along. Missing unit tests must be added before moving on. Since porting Python 2 code to Python 3 code is a standard problem for the Python community, there are many different tools available that can help in this regard. In addition to that, I'd like to extend this project to a bit of a <em>Hausmeister</em> project (<em>housekeeping</em> for Pattern), and optimize/modernize the code base in terms of <em>execution speed</em>, <em>memory usage</em> and <em>documentation</em>.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>CloudCV is a young open source cloud platform  started in 2013 by students and faculty from Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Virginia Tech (now at Georgia Tech) with the aim to make AI research more reproducible. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enables researchers to build, compare and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>CloudCV consists of three major platforms:</p>\n<p><strong>Origami</strong> is a AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to setup the infrastructure, resolve the dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabrik</strong> is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allow researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe and Keras.</p>\n<p><strong>EvalAI</strong> is an evaluation server that will host AI challenges like Visual Question Answering, Image Captioning. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits and different evaluation metrics. By providing a central leaderboard and submission interface, we make it easier for researchers to reproduce the results mentioned in the paper and perform reliable &amp; accurate quantitative analysis.</p>\n",

However, the issue arises when someone has to  setup someone else's code on their machine. Origami aims at solving that problem by allowing researchers to quickly create a  demo of their implementation for the  world to see. This serves a twofold purpose. It lets other users see if a particular implementation solves their purpose while also serving as a 'portfolio' for the researchers.</p>\n<p>By the end of the summer, users will be able to search for various demos published by various researchers and thus be able to find an implementation that suits their needs the best. Additionally, Origami will also support REST APIs. This will allow Origami to be used to provide some infrastructure  for chat bots which can then be integrated with Slack, Facebook, etc. Origami will also be integrated with EvalAI to allow users to compare their implementation with that of their competitors. Finally, Origami will support other features such as allowing users to upload to/from Dropbox, releasing anonymous demos, a better CMS and predefined templates to create apps to name a few.</p>\n",

Current Sphinx dictionaries only support limited words and languages, which is difficult to meet the needs of applications, so expanding dictionaries in Sphinx is an urgent need. It's critical to reuse existing pronunciation dictionaries to improve system performance, support new words appeared recently and more languages. A valuable pronunciation source is Wiktionary, which is a multilingual, web-based project to create a free content dictionary of all words in all languages. Although Wiktionary contains pronunciations for many words and multiple languages in a standard format like IPA, it’s not easy to parse those pronunciations from sources in different page formats and convert phonemes in different languages to one common format like CMUBET which can be used by Sphinx. This project will solve those problems and form at least 10 pronunciation dictionaries which will be tested on several ASR benchmarks for Sphinx.</p>\n",

More recently, robust DNN-based speech recognition techniques have been developed that have been adopted by all major commercial systems including those from Google and Amazon.

The first level consists of convolutional filters and pooling layers that produce convolutional features from each audio frame. The second level consists of a single GRU-based DNN that estimates the output probabilities for each HMM. The optimal state sequence can then be found using Viterbi decoding. Over the course of the project this setup will be optimised by experimenting with different structural parameters for the DNNs as well as different learning techniques.</p>\n",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.</p>\n<h4>How does it work?</h4>\n<p>With coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code,  find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines.\nAll controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.</p>\n<h4>For Users</h4>\n<p>coala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool.\nBesides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.</p>\n<h4>For Developers</h4>\n<p>You can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.</p>\n<h4>For Newcomers</h4>\n<p>coala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.</p>\n",

We make use of bleeding-edge protocol extensions where available, but more than that, we are also actively developing novel approaches to yet unsolved problems. We are not afraid to try new things and our active community is always willing to try out prototype implementations. Furthermore, members of the Conversations team are also part of the XMPP Standards Foundation to standardize newly developed approaches for modern, mobile friendly XMPP.\nOne very successful example of such innovation is OMEMO encryption, which is now supported by 5+ popular XMPP clients and was originally developed for Conversations as a GSoC project.</p>\n<p>Over time, the Conversations project also developed various tools to make life easier for end users and also make the XMPP world more approachable for new comers.

It is interlinked to many other datasets. The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a technology stack called <em>Linked Data</em>, which has been revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web: with Linked Data technologies, all APIs are interconnected via standard Web protocols and languages.</p>\n<h3>The Web of data</h3>\n<p>Such <em>Web of data</em> provides useful knowledge that can complement the <em>Web of documents</em> in many ways. See, for instance, how bloggers tag their posts or assign them to categories in order to organize and interconnect their blog posts. This is a very simple way to connect unstructured text to a structure (hierarchy of tags). For more advanced examples, see how <strong>BBC</strong> has created the <em>World Cup 2010 website</em> by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base.</p>\n<p>Or, more recently, did you see that <strong>IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge</strong>?</p>\n<h3>DBpedia Spotlight</h3>\n<p><strong>DBpedia Spotlight</strong> is an open source text annotation tool that connects text to Linked Data by marking names of things in text (we call that <em>spotting</em>) and selecting between multiple interpretations of these names (we call that <em>disambiguation</em>). For example, <code>Washington</code> can be interpreted in more than 50 ways including a state, a government or a person. You can already imagine that this is not a trivial task, especially when we're talking about millions of things and hundreds of types.</p>\n<h3>We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</h3>\n",

There’s no super secret special paid commercial version with better or more complete features. Because Discourse is 100% open source, now and forever, it belongs to you as much as it belongs to us. That’s how community works.</p>\n<p>Everything that most communities would want is included out of the box; a giant collection of complex plugins should not be required to have a great experience.</p>\n<h5>Further reading:</h5>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.discourse.org/faq/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.discourse.org/faq/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.discourse.org/faq/customers/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.discourse.org/2017/02/discourses-fourth-birthday/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/\" target=\"_blank\">https://blog.discourse.org/2017/01/discourse-1-7-released/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://meta.discourse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://meta.discourse.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.</p>\n",

Instead, Elm uses type inference to detect problems during compilation and give <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/blog/compilers-as-assistants\" target=\"_blank\">friendly hints</a>. This way problems never make it to your users. NoRedInk has 90k+ lines of Elm, and after more than a year in production, it still has not produced a single runtime exception.</p>\n<h3>Great Performance</h3>\n<p>Elm has its own virtual DOM implementation, designed for simplicity and speed. All values are immutable in Elm, and <a href=\"http://elm-lang.org/blog/blazing-fast-html-round-two\" target=\"_blank\">the benchmarks</a> show that this helps us generate particularly fast JavaScript code.</p>\n<h3>Enforced Semantic Versioning</h3>\n<p>Elm can detect all API changes automatically thanks to its type system.

We are also indexing millions of government web pages on a weekly basis, tracking changes to them, and producing regular reports. With data collection efforts well underway and supported by many hundreds of volunteers at events across North America, our focus now turns to building first-rate tools to support our work. We need deep thinkers to develop protocols for the resilient, sustainable, accessible, distributed data storage networks of the future; machine learning experts to sift through millions of web pages to find the most important changes; and security specialists to protect the privacy of our volunteers and ensure the integrity of our data.

Source code defects can be named as weaknesses, which depending on their\ncharacteristics, can lead to security vulnerabilities. In medium and large projects, find\nsuch weaknesses by manually inspecting all the modules of the project, it is infeasible,\nin addition to the fact that active projects launch with some frequency new versions of\nyour product, versions that may come with new weaknesses.  During Google Summer of\ncode period, i’m intend to build a system, that permits to run several static analysis tools in\nsource code packages. I’m working in the past few months in Debile, a tool created by the Debian community to make static analysis on Debian packages.

The first one is modifying the source code module by module to convert it to RPM-based, including replacing the apt command code with the dnf command code or fit both of them, changing the Deb-based packages into RPM-based packages which play the same roles and testing after each module finished. The second part is a little scattered, including making a RPM package for Plinth and setting up a repo for it in <a href=\"https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Copr</a>, testing inside a Virtual Machine, and modifying some configuration files and the documents for users to fit the changes of Plinth during this project, at the same time, a new wiki page for Plinth in Fedora is needed.</p>\n",

It serves only to output a valid bitstream, with little concern about quality. This project aims to improve the general performance of the encoder, bringing it closer to a viable status. This will be done by integrating features of the existing AAC psychoacoustic model system within the native Vorbis encoder and adapting the FFmpeg Vorbis decoder to utilize that new information.

Then it focusses on project implementation, the software lifecycle to be used and the modules in which the system can be divided into. Subsequently, it states application’s ideology and thoroughly explains each module (along with wireframes). It also presents a timeline of the entire project.

Due to the growing influence of smartphones, the requirement of an Android counterpart for PSLab is needed. As per the current development status, the device communicates with the app using an OTG Cable using I2C communication. PSLab has an already existing desktop counterpart and the features like oscilloscope, get data of the various sensors on the board etc. and I wish to integrate most of the features in the app along with some better feature suggestions. The project would require initial development of communication libraries followed by implementation of the proposed features and their rigorous testing. An entire development model needs to be developed which would the writing main code, tests to check validity in certain cases, paying attention to the aesthetics/looks of the app etc. The proposed features would require extensive understanding of communication protocols, using APIs in apps, development of tests &amp; making good UI designs. The proposed project has been divided to development &amp; testing phases with time bound schedules for the same.</p>\n",

It is a non-profit foundation with the mission to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their related ecosystems. The FOSSi Foundation operates as an open, inclusive, vendor-independent community.</p>\n<p>Our goal is to promote and assist free and open digital hardware designs and their ecosystem. Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website <a href=\"http://www.librecores.org\" target=\"_blank\">LibreCores.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.</p>\n<p>With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a <a href=\"http://fossi-foundation.org/gsoc17-ideas.html\" target=\"_blank\">few ideas</a>, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.</p>\n<p>Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Hebden Bridge, UK, on September 8-10.</p>\n",

In its current status, OpTiMSoC offers wide support for experimenting different architectural-level configurations. However, when comes to benchmarking the prototyped platform at software-level, current runtime libraries and operating systems still have to be improved. To address this problem, the goal of this project is integrate OpenRISC Linux Port into OpTiMSoC. To do so, a new manycore configuration with a Host Tile will be designed and implemented. The Host Tile will run OpenRISC Linux and will be able to communicate with Gzll kernels running on Computing Tiles via message-passing through the Network-on-Chip (NoC). Overall, the communication infrastructure will be exported to user-level through standard UNIX file system operations.</p>\n",

Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Perforce and Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, OpenBSM and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Ensembl was created alongside the publication of the first draft of the human genome, in 2001, to distribute this goldmine of information to scientists across the world. It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.</p>\n",

The second plugin gives the user a sense of time, by drawing vertical lines each ten seconds (or other period of time). For example, it will be useful when the user zooms in and wants to move along the timeline, because Pitivi will display guidelines. Finally, the third one is a plugin that avoid the tedious process of dragging video (or image) clips over other video (or image) clips in order to create a transition when there are a very large set of this clips. This plugin will save time to users who just want to import a set of images (of last vacation trip for example) to create a video as fast as possible.</p>\n",

The Todoist plugin inside To DO will make use of the todoist v7 API to make sync calls for process like loading tasks,lists or updating tasks etc. Todoist server responds to every request with a JSON response. The Todoist provider would check the JSON response for error and if correct process it to retrieve requested data.\nAt the end of the project we will have a working Todoist plugin which will be a nice addition to To Do.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.</p>\n<p>The proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

For this reason, it is crucial to guarantee a certain high quality of service (QoS). This QoS may be degraded by the presence of spurious undesirable signals coming from jammers that could degrade partially (or totally) the bandwidth of the desired GNSS signal.\nBasically, two kinds of Radio Frequency Interferences (RFI) can disturb a GNSS signal. Each one has its own characteristic spectral feature and a classification based on that is described as following:\n•    Continuous wave interferences (CWI): a perturbation of a relative small part of the spectrum and can be mitigated by means of a notch filter.\n•    Short pulsed interferences: with an instantaneous bandwidth that usually covers the entire GNSS band and can be partially removed by means of a blanking filter. \nTwo interference detection and mitigation algorithms will be evaluated in order to implement a new Signal conditioner block into GNSS-SDR. These algorithms will be coded in C++</p>\n",

There are two sides to the project:</p>\n<h4>For Drivers</h4>\n<p>On one side, we want to provide drivers of electric vehicles with practical solutions, that is, with optimal driving direction for their route. For that we are developing a platform independent navigation system.</p>\n<h4>For Scientists</h4>\n<p>On the other side, we want to develop tools for scientifically analyzing algorithmic solutions. For that we are developing tools for visualization of algorithms, for comparing their performance, we want to provide a generic API for custom algorithms and a lot more.</p>\n<h4>Ideas</h4>\n<p>Instead of working towards a specific electric vehicel, we want to leverage machine learning to derive the parameters automatically, getting better with every route.</p>\n",

We have adapted it to work beyond the framework of a single corporate entity via federated efforts of individuals and companies with distinct interests in the technology (cloud infrastructure, storage systems, application servers, and others), sharing an interest in commodity hardware and production-driven innovation.</p>\n<p>illumos features an unparalleled combination of technologies, including the resilient ZFS storage system, production-safe dynamic tracing (DTrace), FMA predictive self-healing, the Service Management Framework for persistent process and boot management, zones for lightweight isolation and virtualisation, the KVM hypervisor for full system virtualisation, Crossbow for virtualised networks, a high-performance kernel CIFS/SMB client and server, boot environments for safe upgrades, and the MDB kernel and application debugger. All of these subsystems are actively developed by the illumos project. Both ZFS and DTrace have been ported beyond illumos (notably to FreeBSD, OS X, and Linux), where our community and sister OpenZFS community have taken a leading role in coordinating new feature development across platforms, serving as a reference platform and repository</p>\n",

However, bottleneck exists in terms of how much data can be transferred between hard disk and memory for computation  [1]. As research increasingly relies on processing huge volumes of data, this issue demands attention. One strategy which addresses this is memory compression of data in memory (DRAM). Algorithms that are effective do a good job of decompressing exactly as much of the data as are needed for the calculations, so that they still minimize the memory footprint of the program without significant speed drops.</p>\n<p>This proposal exists to address this bottleneck within the Neuromapp program created by members of the Blue Brain Project team. The project proposed is split into research and implementation of in-memory compression along the lines of compression library selection, interface algorithm development, and block data structure design. The resulting compression mini-app is intended to relieve this bottleneck, and provide accelerated calculation capacity for the suite of associated mini-apps that come with Neuromapp.</p>\n",

However, the limitation of GeNN is that it can only support running on a single GPU or a single shared-memory machine. This proposal is to plan for expanding GeNN to multiple machine clusters. MPI is common message passing interface and infrastructure to communicate across multiple hosts and it is natural to expand GeNN with MPI interface to achieve parallel execution on multiple hosts. The key point of this project is to balance GeNN computation simulations across MPI hierarchy between hosts and block/thread on individual GPU. Furthermore, This proposal shows potential tuning directions basing on MPI-CUDA hierarchy. To bridge the gap between the destination and implementation, this proposal also describes  feasible stages for the MPI-GeNN project and narrates the candidate’s motivation, background and progressive approach.

          "abstract_html": "<p>CBS Tools are specialized Java-based image processing tools for ultra-high field MRI data. Making this potent software more easily accessible to researchers will accelerate progress in the promising field of high-resolution neuroimaging. The goal of my project is therefore to make CBS Tools available through Nipy, a popular “community of practice devoted to the use of the Python programming language in the analysis of neuroimaging data”. First steps have been made to encapsulate CBS Tools’ Java classes using the JCC package, enabling access through Python. Within the Google Summer of Code I would like to take this further and provide easy-to-use and well-documented Python interfaces for the core modules of CBS Tools. Since rapid advances in the dynamic field of high-resolution neuroimaging are to be expected, another focus of my proposal is to facilitate future contribution of other researchers. My three main objectives are (1) to provide straightforward installation routines for different platforms, (2) to create Nipype interfaces for the core modules and (3) to make the code accessible through documentation and realistic examples.</p>\n",

It has already developed good logical structures for sending of push notifications using JMS. Moreover,  its \"sender\" module is mainly constructed of different message queues and their producers and consumers. On the other hand, the server DB is currently based on MySQL/PostgreSQL and each data entry lies in one DB scheme.\n   We need the process for sending of push notifications and the evaluation of message metrics to be as fast as possible and as scalable as possible. Therefore, with an increase of our data problems can be caused by slow writes/reads to DB and not scalable enough message queue usage.\n    The idea of the project is to try to overcome these obstacles and rebuild some modules of the system in the way that they perform well even if the data volume they are operating over increases. For that two different approaches can be taken. To speed up the DB access a new distributed, scalable, big data store HBase can be integrated into the project. For more scalable processing of the data, Apache Kafka can be used instead of JMS.</p>\n",

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent software. It is written in C++ and Python, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE communication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.</p>\n<p>Real robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.</p>\n<p>Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor or the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.</p>\n<p>JdeRobot include several tools: robot teleoperators, a tuner for color filters, a tool for visual creation of automata (Finite State Machine) that control robot behavior, etc. The web browsers also may be used to directly connect to the robots, their sensors and actuators.</p>\n<p>Includes a framework for teaching robotics [ <a href=\"http://jderobot.org/Teaching_robotics_with_JdeRobot\" target=\"_blank\">http://jderobot.org/Teaching_robotics_with_JdeRobot</a> ]. Several exercises have been developed: for visual control of a Formula1, autonomous navigation of a taxi inside a city, drone rescue missions, computer vision, etc.</p>\n",

Details for the project:\nProject #5. Teaching Robotics: Translation of a Scratch program to ROS python components\nScratch is a free visual programming language used in children's education, to teach them basic programming. It is composed of graphical building blocks (instructions) that must be visually connected to build the program. The idea here is to take benefit of our experience translating from a graphical description of a program in visual HFSM into a JdeRobot-ROS component to do the same with a different visual language, Scratch. The goal is to explore the use of Scratch with robots, both simulated or real, that JdeRobot-ROS allows and simplifies. We will start with simulated robots in Gazebo, despite with real robots will be the same as they use the same interfaces.\nThis project expects to develop a new tool prototype that reads Scratch programs and translate them into ROS Python components.</p>\n",

Joomla! 4 will be the next generation which is going to use more modern technologies.</p>\n<p>Joomla! has a built in Media Manager to manage media files, such that even a novice can easily upload and use them in his articles etc. In Joomla! 4, the media manager will get rewritten from scratch with a JavaScript based (Vue.js) client and a REST like API as data endpoint. Through this endpoint it is possible to make GET, POST, PUT and DELETE requests to fetch and manipulate the media files. On the server side are the requests forwarded to an adapter, which processes the data.</p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to add more cloud based file adapter’s through the Joomla plugin system for the media manager which allow the other developers to extend the capability of it. They can add a cloud file system to Joomla! which allows the users to interact with media files the same way as with local files.</p>\n",

I believe that my education, work and project experience make me the perfect candidate for this project.\nThe general purpose of the project is getting early feedback for every newly submitted code. By creating a fully working environment to run tests for Joomla code, so that they can run in a parallel (container-based) environment, increasing speed and coverage of PHP and Joomla versions. The key requirement here is speed, it is crucial to get early feedback on new PRs. In order to achieve this, tests not dependent on each other will be run on different containers simultaneously.</p>\n",

Adding support for the CONDSTORE extension will help to greatly reduce the time and data spent on resynchronization.</p>\n<h5>Search</h5>\n<p>K-9 Mail has a basic search feature that searches the local database as well as the remote server for messages. The project aims to add features that make it more modern, such as suggestions, nested search, filters and proper full-text search.</p>\n<h5>Miscellaneous improvements</h5>\n<p>Support for some additional IMAP operations will also be added :</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using the UID EXPUNGE command when available so that messages deleted by other clients are not expunged by accident.</li>\n<li>Switching  between and modifying namespaces.</li>\n<li>Moving messages across different IMAP accounts.</li>\n</ul>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>\n<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</li>\n<li>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.

Radiation induced Single Event Upsets can trigger bit flips in memory that could have catastrophic consequences rendering a cubesat useless.

Recent secure processors and trusted environment encrypt memory contents to protect those important memory operations. However, sometimes just encrypting data is not enough since there are intelligent attackers who can see where the memory access goes to and infer where the real important data lies in. Those important data includes the private data, key, or OS fingerprint and else. These kind of attacks lead to concept of “memory obliviousness” to secure memory address itself. ORAM refers to Oblivious memory which can leverage obliviousness using specialized data structures and obfuscate memory access so even an attacker see or probe the memory access itself, he never learns about where important data lies on or even where the memory requests are headed to. Initially proposed by Goldreich and Ostrovsky, ORAM obfuscates memory access using random permutation, shuffling and encryption of contents. In this proposal, I’ll implement ORAM interface to support obliviousness on RISC-V’s trusted execution environment.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Microkernels are operating systems that outsource the traditional operating system functionality to ordinary user processes while providing them with mechanisms requisite for implementing it. Microkernel-based operating systems come in many different flavours, each having a distinctive set of goals, features and approaches. Some of the most often cited reasons for structuring the system as a microkernel is flexibility, security and fault tolerance. Many microkernels can take on the role of a hypervisor, too. Microkernels and their user environments are most often implemented in the C or C++ programming languages with a little bit of assembly, but other implementation languages (such as Rust) are possible, too. In fact, each component of a microkernel-based system can be implemented in a different programming language.</p>\n<p>We are the collective body representing <a href=\"http://genode.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Genode</a>, <a href=\"http://www.helenos.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HelenOS</a>, <a href=\"https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/\" target=\"_blank\">GNU Hurd</a>, <a href=\"http://www.minix3.org/\" target=\"_blank\">MINIX 3</a> and <a href=\"https://www.redox-os.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Redox</a> microkernel-based operating systems. Our cooperation dates back to 2012 when we first met at the <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/\" target=\"_blank\">FOSDEM</a> conference in Brussels and organized the first track (a.k.a. a devroom) entirely dedicated to microkernels and related technologies. The <a href=\"https://fosdem.org/2017/schedule/track/microkernels_and_component_based_os/\" target=\"_blank\">Microkernel devroom</a> has since become a de facto institutionalized feature of each FOSDEM. Now we also take part in the Google Summer of Code as a mentoring organization in order to function as an umbrella for our respective member projects.</p>\n",

An example of this is the Pedometer component which stops running when the phone screen is off. Ideally, a pedometer app would want to keep running once started in the background until the user of the app explicitly stops it. To enable such behavior it is necessary to run such components in a background process and re-start the process every time the system kills it.</p>\n",

Each of the features/key-points are associated with some sort of key signatures (called descriptors of those key points). Many existing methods for detection/description of these features exists, each descriptor has certain properties that are suitable for certain vision applications. Some of the existing methods include SIFT, SURF, BRISK, FAST, ORB,AKAZE, LATCH, LSD/BLD (lines), etc. Some of the detectors already provide descriptors but some of them do not, so different combinations of descriptors can be used. In this project a GUI application is built which evaluates these descriptors/key-points. The app also provides a means to benchmark these features for certain vision tasks like Visual Odometry, Tracking and Place Recognition. A second mini project of extending the MRPT ROS package to playback MRPT Datasets in ROS RViz is also implemented.</p>\n",

What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?</p>\n<h4>Minimal Engine</h4>\n<p>Our engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.</p>\n<h4>Extensibility</h4>\n<p>Any content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.</p>\n<p>Creating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.</p>\n",

PDF.js current uses xhr for networking to fetch data, but it is inefficient in terms of memory as it has to buffer all the response. As xhr is an ever growing buffer, it stores all the data in its internal buffer, this uses lots of memory. Using Streams API, we can use the response incrementally and pass it for parsing and rendering as soon as it is received, hence there is no need to buffer the whole response. For rendering purpose, PDF.js makes chunks of data by parsing pdf commands in worker thread. After chunking the whole data, it is passed to the main thread for painting. Buffering the entire data in the worker thread uses a huge amount memory, and main thread also has to wait for the entire data to be parsed. This creates inefficiency in terms of memory and speed. Using Streams API, we can send the chunks from worker thread to main thread as soon as they are created, reducing the memory usage and increases speed. Since Streams API is a new technology, using it in PDF.js will test Firefox's implementation.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Systems biology researchers study the network of molecular interactions within a biological system and publish the deduced models in a diagram format. Many XML variants were developed to represent diagrams, including SBML and SBGN. However, SBML can represent much more complex models than SBGN. For example, the SBML qual extension package can mechanistically describe events in its models, such as the relationship that A activates C, B activates C, but A and B cannot activate C at the same time. The SBGN Activity Flow language can describe a similar relationship, but the relationship is represented visually only, and therefore is not stored in its model. The incompatibilities between SBML and SBGN prevent direct comparison between the models.</p>\n<p>In this project, I will build tools to support bidirectional conversion between SBML and SBGN, which acts as a machinery to map between SBGN-specific and SBML-specific information. SBML Layout package will be used to represent SBML diagrams, and the SBML qual package used to store the logic model.</p>\n<p>Blog: <a href=\"http://haleyyew-gsoc.blogspot.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">http://haleyyew-gsoc.blogspot.ca/</a></p>\n<p>Repository: <a href=\"https://github.com/NRNB-GSoC2017-SBML2SBGNML-Converters/SBML2SBGNML\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/NRNB-GSoC2017-SBML2SBGNML-Converters/SBML2SBGNML</a></p>\n",

However, applying known algorithms may not be enough every time to extract the useful information. Some specialized queries may be helpful in this sence to extract more useful or more specific information. Actually, these types of queries are already implemented inside the PATIKAweb software that is a result of the study done by Doğrusöz et al. in Java programming language. The aim of this project is to move these implementations into the common use of developers by making an extension to Cytoscape.js, which is a commonly used graph drawing library written in Javascript. Cytoscape.js already includes some basic graph traversal algorithms such as DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Kruskal etc., but I believe that these specialized queries will provide a good functionality to be used in not only in biological networks, but also in other types of networks. With the advantage of compound node support in Cytoscape.js, these specialized traversal algorithms will also be easily applied to the large networks with compound node content.</p>\n",

While SBML is made use of by the simulation aspect of IBW, the design-based SBOL is used by the Biocompiler as a format to write its compiled design into. This project aims to enhance the Biocompiler’s ability to export and import SBOL and SBML. If IBW’s capacity to work with these two biological modelling standards is improved, its accessibility to computational biologists around the world would increase dramatically.

It currently exists as both a web app and a standalone software package.  PiType is designed to classify proteins within a network into different categories: Mutually Exclusive (ME) vs Simultaneously Possible (SP) and Obligate (O) vs Non-Obligate (NO).  To do this, PiType takes a series of proteins within a network, analyses them to determine which of the above categories they fit into, and outputs that information as a table.  Because of the current input and output format, it is difficult for biologists to analyze and interpret the data. Cytoscape is open source software that provides numerous modules for studying and visualizing protein networks, and as such is the perfect tool to use for PiType. My project over the summer will thus be to create a Cytoscape plugin app using PiType’s already existent algorithms, to create a visualization tool that provides an intuitive interface for biologists.  By taking the base features of PiType, and implementing them as a Cytoscape plugin, my project will widen the number of potential users, and the utility of the app.</p>\n",

Many SBOL-compliant tools already exist which perform distinct and useful functions ranging from component design, modeling, composition, simulation, figure creation, storage, sharing, and publication. In 2016, ACS Synthetic Biology recommended that all authors submit genetic designs using SBOL. An example workflow for doing so was published in 2016 (Hillson), and each of the parts of the workflow can be fulfilled by extant tools, but the integrations between tools can be made more robust.  For example, the SynBioHub service allows for storage and sharing of SBOL parts, VisBOL allows for creation of SBOL visual images from SBOL files, and iBioSim and SBOL Designer allow for creation and composition of SBOL parts. SBOL Designer and iBioSim allow for upload of parts to an instance of SynBioHub, but there are many opportunities to improve this workflow with authentication, security, and sharing capabilities.</p>\n",

Unfortunately, nose is no longer under active development so the community has decided to shift over to pytest. Another problem is the performance of the current testsuite in terms of execution time. Currently the TravisCI build takes around 45 minutes (50 min. being the cap). This causes builds to fail because they are terminated on exceeding the maximum execution time. The objective of this project is to implement this shift in a way that existing development work is not affected and to improve performance of the existing test cases and to make it more maintainable in general.</p>\n",

Consequently, several difficulties are found when improvements/changes need to be performed. This library is commonly described as too verbose, implying most of the times, string concatenations and mixed code for both presentation and logic. Subsequently, it is not much intuitive. In addition, recent patch update from 1.2.9 to 1.2.10 resulted in a backward compatibility break, and as a minor patch should not raise compatibility issues, the trust in this library is somehow compromised.\nTemplate Engines overcome the majority of the issues related to output generation. They are powerful tools that allow the developers to speed up their work in an easier and much cleaner way.</p>\n<p>This project proposes moving antiSMASH to jinja2, a well known, widely used and developer-friendly templating language for Python. With this migration, we intend to facilitate the future development of antiSMASH as well as the onboarding of new developers to the team. Moreover, considering jinja2 enormous user-base and applications, a backwards compatibility break in a minor version is unlikely.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Although RDKit is a widely used extremely versatile chemoinformatics software package, it still lacks efficient 3D molecule visualization capability. In this circumstance, 3Dmol.js is easy to use and an excellent molecule visualization library that works in web browser. Another important platform is jupyter that allows communication with python from web browser through notebook like interface. Jupyter has also made the codes easily readable with clean output by dint of markdown. So, keeping python as operational core engine that expectedly works as interface of RDKit while utilizing support from jupyter notebook and 3Dmol.js should be a very good combination to ensure high productivity in drug discovery settings. In this project, I would like to turn these combination to more viable solution by binding 3D molecule visualization (protein-ligand complex), ligand editing panel, conformer scrolling system, and channel for sending ligand from jupyter interface to force field that exists in RDKit for energy minimization. Needless to say, I would like to use openbabel for file format conversion and molecular data extraction system.</p>\n",

More importantly, with the introduction of google cardboard, even a smartphone can now be used to visualize stereoscopic images and videos for literally no extra cost.

The idea is to extend 3dmol.js to be able to project stereoscopic images so that it can be viewed using a phone browser through any low cost cardboard headset. Stereoscopic rendering will make the visualization of simulation results much clearer, especially while explaining interesting atomic scale phenomena such as bonds breaking or denaturation of proteins etc. to students in class.

While decisions and actions are currently signed, citizens or even the government institutions, who do not own an immediate signed document (that is a short time after the document was uploaded), have no guarantee that this document was not altered some time after the upload. Thus, in order to limit the time span in which a document can be altered, Diavgeia is forced to store a log in Bitcoin Blockchain, at predefined time intervals.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>Limit hard disk space needs of Diavgeia by having decisions stored as RDF. Thus, Diavgeia a rdf-ontology and an on demand RDF to PDF converter is provided.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>Diavgeia links RDF decisions  to other greek ontologies (such as legislation) and promotes Open Linked Data.

Devanagari are designed with an axis mirrored in relation to the Latin. This is a significant start regarding the addition of Greek glyphs, since one has a glimpse of the designer’s original aesthetics and design intentions; it also provides a good basis for certain letterforms that could be transferred into the Greek design, rendering a balanced outcome for all the supported scripts.</p>\n",

We seek to develop a protocol that allows their storage, the mixin columns, in FITS and ASCII ECSV, while still ensuring \"round-tripping\".

This algorithm was presented by   Jonathan T. Barron and Ben Poole as an ECCV2016 oral and best paper nominee. Algorithm details and applications   can be found in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.03296.pdf</a> [1]</p>\n<p>Significance:\nThe naive bilateral filtering functions in OpenCV are generally computationally expensive and often insufficient for  solving more challenging computer vision tasks. By contrast, the bilateral solver is 10-1000× faster than existing  domain-specific approaches with comparable accuracy, and produces higher-quality output than lightweight filtering  techniques with comparable runtimes.</p>\n",

And this requirement is even more essential for emerging usages on web, such as Web Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality (WebVR). The OpenCV is the de-facto standard C/C++ library for image and vision processing extensively used by computer vision community. But OpenCV is unavailable to web applications today. Thanks to OpenCV.js, an open source project initiated in Parallel Architectures and Systems Group at UC Irvine, by utilizing Emscripten LLVM-to-JavaScript compiler, it makes the first step to prove OpenCV can be exposed to web with high performance. This proposal aims to merge OpenCV.js into official OpenCV repository which makes JavaScript as one of the language bindings of OpenCV. So it requires refactoring the structure, addressing several shortcomings and code optimization of existing OpenCV.js.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (<a href=\"http://regenstrief.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://regenstrief.org</a>), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (<a href=\"http://pih.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://pih.org</a>), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The developer is now free to host his module in any of the supported hosting sites while Add Ons does the job of adding it to the OpenMRS module index .

By allowing 3D models to be used in OSM 3D visualizers, the quality and ease of creation of the rendering can be improved. To implement this repository by the proposed deadline, I have decided to use the Django/Python framework, with PostgreSQL as the database backend, and for the front end Bootstrap was chosen. The OpenLayers library will also be used to render slippy maps to the user. The repository includes an user interface allowing uploading models from an authenticated OSM account through the OAuth mechanism, and an API for 3D visualizers to use, so that they can query the repository for models. Finally, while there were a plethora of interesting features that could be included in the deadline checklists, I have opted for only having the essential features required for a 3D repository as deliverables, with the rest as extra features, to be added if time allows it.</p>\n",

Therefore, a web application like Jangouts, implementing WebRTC expects to monitor the performance of the underlying network and media pipeline. As a solution to this problem, I propose to integrate callstats.io into Jangouts. callstats.io is a SaaS service that helps WebRTC services detect and diagnose media and network quality issues. This project aims to give an option to companies and individuals deploying Jangouts to use this service in a user-friendly way. This task can be completed by sending WebRTC events and measurement data from the Jangouts application and the Janus media server in real-time to callstats.io. The idea is to integrate the callstats.io REST API with the WebRTC components in Jangouts and Janus. The Jangouts app will send endpoint stats and Janus will send the stats related to the WebRTC gateway.</p>\n",

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/en\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to <em>WiFi Metropolitano</em>: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.</p>\n<p> The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller\" target=\"_blank\">wifi controller</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.</p>\n",

Explorations are dynamic and interactive, meaning there are multiple paths through the exploration depending on the answers the learner submits (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor; an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven content creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate easily creating targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community aspect of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

The project also requires implementing code classifier which will  allow creators to train a classifier for code interaction input.

It provides Machine learning - as - a - service infrastructure for Oppia. Moreover prediction should be done in the frontend, in users computer so that there is no need of internet connection for giving feedback to the user. The outcome of this project is complete integration of machine learning framework and make it available to end user in production environment.</p>\n",

The dashboard will keep track of the explorations and collections completed by learners, the explorations and collections that are currently in progress, the creators to whom the learner has subscribed to and the list of feedback threads which he/she needs to read or respond to. In addition, learners can also create their own curated list of explorations and collections which they may want to play later.</p>\n<p>The learner dashboard will help provide an enriching learning experience and will bridge the gap between learners and creators. It'll be at the heart of the learning process and help the learner learn faster. In addition, this project will create the foundation for implementing a rich set of features like recommending the right next courses for individual learners and many other such exciting possibilities. This project, I believe, would mark a major milestone in accomplishing Oppia's mission - 'to help anyone learn anything they want in an effective and enjoyable way'.</p>\n",

The plugin provides a way to include QGIS in the data processing workflow of other (‘mapping-deficient’) programming languages over a HTTP interface which mirrors the existing QGIS API, without precluding the ability to make use of its interactive editing components. The project also covers the generation and documentation of automated geospatial analysis workflow examples using Jupyter notebooks for both Python and R. The example notebooks will integrate data obtained from Open Data repositories with use cases of the QGIS Web API as well as other OSGeo geospatial libraries to demonstrate the potential of automatic report generation for open source GIS analysis.</p>\n",

Recently I have been involved with a lot of real time applications .The hidden motivation behind choosing this project is mainly due to an application I recently developed, Latch for a hackathon. It is a Location based chat application, using Django as the primary backend server and Node.js for real time data handling. I already had an idea of developing a similar video based application which introduced me to WebRTC. I saw this project of Virtual Room in P2PSP, and the idea of an open source real time video streaming application fascinated me a lot.

      "description_html": "<h3>Why PEcAn?</h3>\n<p>Climate change science has witnessed an explosion in the amount and types of data that can be brought to bear on the potential responses of the terrestrial carbon cycle and biodiversity to global change. Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

People should be able to walk up to any smart device - a vending machine, a poster, a toy, a bus stop, a rental car - and not have to download an app first. Everything should be just a tap away.</p>\n<p>The number of smart devices is going to explode, and the assumption that each new device will require its own application just isn’t realistic. We need a system that lets anyone interact with any device at any time. The Physical Web isn’t about replacing native apps: it’s about enabling interaction when native apps just aren’t practical.</p>\n<p>The Physical Web Project is the Google Summer of Code proposal for university students interested in developing applications around that technology. The Physical Web Project, while making use of Physical Web software, does not develop the Physical Web code-base itself. Physical Web is an open standard that everyone can use. By creating a common web standard that any device can use to offer interaction, a new range of services becomes possible. Instead, the Physical Web Project works on extending the Physical Web system with open source software enabling open source applications.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>PMD is a static code analyzer. It finds common programming flaws, sub-optimal code and code style issues in multiple languages. For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.</p>\n<h3>Programming Languages</h3>\n<p>Initially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 7 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.</p>\n<h3>Copy-Paste-Detector</h3>\n<p>Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in Java, C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, JavaScript, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, Swift and Salesforce.com Apex.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>PMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>PMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.</p>\n<p>An innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.</p>\n",

It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, SGI IRIX, Mac OS X, Solaris, Tru64), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.  An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate.  There are active PostgreSQL systems in production environments that manage in excess of 30 terabytes of data.<br>\nPostgreSQL has won praise from its users and industry recognition, including the Linux New Media Award for Best Database System and five time winner of the The Linux Journal Editors' Choice Award for best DBMS.</p>\n",

Any UPDATE or DELETE statement on a Primary Key table would trigger an IR constraint violation check on the Foreign Key table which can only be accomplished by a sequential search. This renders the feature unusable for large tables. I plan to make the array GIN-indexable. Since GIN-Indexes seem very reasonable since GIN is primarily used to search for element values (PK values) that appear within composite items (FK array).  This would greatly decrease the computation time since we can utilize the GIN class operator “&lt;@” (included in). I found some statistics that support the GIN vs. Sequential scan, they are included in the proposal.</p>\n",

PostgreSQL uses a double-linked list in the shared memory to record all conflicts of each transaction. Based on the list structure, the rw-conflict tracking has a time complexity of O(N^2). The designer assumed that the list is short so that the overhead can be ignored. However, some benchmarks reported that the conflict-tracking took up to half the CPU time at high concurrency levels, where searching the list becomes a bottleneck. There are five static functions existing in the project to manage the rw-conflicts. We intend to rewrite these functions by replacing linked list with other data structures to support faster search. There are two possible replacements. Hash table is the first choice because there is an existing implementation of hash table (HTAB) in shared memory in PostgreSQL. Skip list is the other choice as it is similar to the linked list.</p>\n",

This project aims at porting an updated version of the five-dimensional beamformer to analyze time-frequency data in source space (Dalal et al., 2008; implemented in MNE-Python as “tf_lcmv”). \nThe update adopts the Hilbert transform to obtain a continuous amplitude and phase time series per frequency band, in contrast to the previous method that utilizes discrete time windows and does not retain phase information. It also adds a weight normalization option to the LCMV beamformer (neural activity index and unit noise gain), which will be available for other LCMV versions as well.\nFurthermore, statistical testing of the Hilbert beamformer output using the Wilcoxon rank sum test will be implemented to complete the new Hilbert beamformer pipeline. Due to the size of the MEG data and intensiveness of the calculations, the code will be developed with memory efficiency and parallelization in mind.\nInteractive visualization of source-localized time frequency representations will complete the Hilbert beamformer routine.</p>\n",

The second, perhaps equally important, is to showcase how NIMBLE can serve as a computational engine “under the hood” of an R package, and to develop extensions to NIMBLE that will support its use in this way.

But, that is exactly where the main hiccup of biodiversity research lies. Since there are many such organizations, the data aggregated by these organizations vary in precision and in quality. Further, though in recent times more researchers have started to use R for their data analyses, since they need to retrieve, manage and assess data with complex (DwC) structure and high volume, only researchers with extremely sound R programming background have been able to attempt this. So we propose to create a R Package that will function as the main data retrieval, cleaning, management and backup tool to the researchers</p>\n",

Time series modeling using sentiment from text requires its own package because of the intrinsic challenge that for a given text we can compute sentiment in hundreds of different ways, as well as the large number of possibilities to pool sentiment across text and time. This additional layer of manipulation does not exist in standard time series analysis. The package aims to derive the optimal sentiment extraction and aggregation for the forecasting task. Aggregation can be optimized across several dimensions, for example word term weighting schemes or time lag structures. The package created therefore integrates the qualification of sentiment from text, the aggregation into different sentiment measures and the optimized forecasting based on these measures. No such integrated textual sentiment forecasting approach exists in any R package. The goal is to provide an automated means to measure the impact of sentiment in texts on a given variable, obtaining readily interpretable and useful outputs and an object to play with, when using this package.</p>\n",

High-density clusters are defined on a population with density <em>f</em> in <em>r</em> dimensions to be the maximal connected sets of form <em>{ x : f(x) &gt;= lambda }</em>, for any <em>lambda &gt; 0</em>. Varying this density level lambda across all possible density thresholds forms a hierarchy of density level sets known as the cluster tree.</p>\n<p>In 1981, the asymptotic behavior of various linkage criteria were studied by by Hartigan in the context of the cluster tree. During this effort,  a notion of consistency---now often referred to as \"Hartigan consistency\"---was introduced.

Second, I will add a full range of state-of-the-art higher order comoment estimators, currently not available for the community. Since these estimators greatly improve the accuracy of estimating the skewness and kurtosis of linear combinations of random variables, all functions in PerformanceAnalytics and PortfolioAnalytics depending on these moments will be more reliable. This is in particular important for risk or performance measures depending on higher order moments in the package PerformanceAnalytics, as well as certain objective functions or constraints in the package PortfolioAnalytics.</p>\n",

A seminal contribution in this field was the development of the GARCH model by Bollerslev (1986) where the volatility is a function of past asset returns. The GARCH model is today a widespread tool in risk management. However, recent studies show that estimates of GARCH models can be biased by structural breaks in the volatility dynamics (Bauwens et al., 2010; Bauwens et al., 2014). These structural breaks typically occur during periods of financial turmoil. Estimating a GARCH model on data displaying a structural break yields a non-stationary estimated model and implies poor risk predictions. A way to cope with this problem is provided by Markov-switching GARCH models (MSGARCH) whose parameters vary over time according to some regimes. These models can quickly adapt to variations in the unconditional volatility level, which improves risk predictions (see Ardia, 2008).</p>\n",

It uses a combination of CNN-RNN (Convolutional-Recurrent Neural Network), 3D convolutions (C3D) and audio features, as shown in the winning solution of EmotiW 2016 competition. A special RNN called LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is used to learn the motion by taking the individual features of each image frame, extracted by the CNN. The 3D convolutional network, works in a way such that it takes care of the image as well as flow of the video (appearance and motion). For extracting the audio features, it uses the OpenSmile toolkit. The EmotiW dataset is used for training this network. The goal of this project is to give an API which will take a video from the user and returns the output regarding the characteristics of emotion. This API will be fully tested, documented with examples and will be deployable in the HPC.</p>\n",

A triplet-loss function during training can constrain the network to learn an embedding space where Euclidean distance corresponds to acoustic similarity. In such a space, algorithms like k-Nearest Neighbors can be used for classification. The network weights can be visualized to glean insight about the low- and high-level features it has learned to look for (pitch, timbre, unknowns, etc.) I also propose to obtain visualizations of the embedding space of laughter sounds using dimension reduction techniques like Principal Components Analysis (PCA) and t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

The current speaker recognition system of the pipeline although fully functional, is not yet ready for processing news videos archived in the NewsScape. The main reason is lack of training data from relevant speakers to enroll into the system. Manually extracting such training data by human experts is inefficient, time-consuming or even infeasible at large scale. On the other hand, for a significant part of the archive (videos recorded over a decade since 2007), there are transcripts (the tpt files) that contain caption and speaker information saved along with the videos. These transcripts can potentially be used to automatically extract speaker training data, if they are accurately aligned with the audios. Therefore, the core idea of this proposal is to establish a workflow in the current audio pipeline from Gentle alignment to accurate timestamps of speech boundaries, then to speaker training data, and finally to identified speakers.</p>\n",

Those features are far from capturing how does the stimuli actually sound to us, and the best we can do is to ask a human subject to judge.\nThe following project aims to bridge the gap between human- and machine-like sound understanding by building an audio embedding space. Such embeddings have been proven extremely successful for texts (word2vec) and images (image recognition, convolutional neural networks, vgg). The aim of this project is to offer similar insight into the nature of the audio stimuli. \nThe embedding space will be obtained by a machine learning model trained to perform on various audio task. Deliverables are: the architecture (data loading and preprocessing pipeline, deep neural network for universal feature extraction and classifiers train separately for each task), ready-to-load optimized parameters, and a use case tutorial (github repository).</p>\n",

SciRuby consists of a <a href=\"https://goo.gl/uWnVub\" target=\"_blank\">fairly large number of gems</a>, including statsample, statsample-glm, statsample-timeseries, distribution, minimization, integration, rubyvis, plotrb, Nyaplot, MDArray, Publisci, Ruby-Band, daru, rubex, and NMatrix.</p>\n<p>NMatrix <a href=\"https://goo.gl/zSycrJ\" target=\"_blank\">has been awarded grants</a> by the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/C2Cd3T\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Association</a> in 2012 and 2015, and has a goal of supplying Ruby with a robust, versatile linear algebra library with support for both dense and sparse matrices. Statsample and its related packages aim to provide Ruby with statistical analysis packages, while daru, nyaplot and gnuplotrb take care of data analysis and visualization. Nyaplot was awarded the <a href=\"https://goo.gl/usseDY\" target=\"_blank\">Ruby Association Grant in 2014</a>, and Rubex and tensorflow.rb <a href=\"https://goo.gl/QNiMq9\" target=\"_blank\">received it in 2016</a>.</p>\n<p>Working on SciRuby is a chance to get involved at the ground floor on a project which is viewed as critical by many Rubyists, including Ruby's creator, Matz. In fact, all the grants issued in 2016 by the Ruby Association (which is headed by Matz) have gone to scientific projects.</p>\n<p>Since we are first and foremost a science-related project, we expect successful student projects to lead to publications. Better yet, students might get to see their code go into orbit, or used to save lives in biomedical research.</p>\n",

Modular decomposition is decomposition of graph into modules. A module is a subset of vertices and it is a generalization of connected component in graph. Let us take for example a module X. For any vertex v ∉ X it is either connected or not connected to every vertex of X. Another property of module is that a module can be subset of another module. There are various algorithms which have been published for modular decomposition of graphs. The focus in this project is on linear time complexity algorithms which can be practically implemented. The project further aims to use the modules developed for modular decomposition to implement other functionality like skew partitions. Skew partition is partition of graph into two sets of vertices such that induced graph formed by one set is disconnected and induced graph formed by other set is complement of the first. \nModular decomposition is a very important concept in Graph Theory and it has a number of use cases. For instance it has been an important tool for solving optimization and combinatorics problems.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>A Scalable language</h3>\n<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.</p>\n<p>Scala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.</p>\n<h3>Object-Oriented</h3>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method-call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.</p>\n<h3>Functional</h3>\n<p>Even though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n<h3>Seamless Java Interop</h3>\n<p>Scala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Fun</h3>\n<p>Maybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”</p>\n",

However, as compiling Java to llvm is not supported, there is a need to reimplement parts of the JDK. As it is currently work in progress, I could help contributors to achieve this goal. One of the most important milestones is implementing JDK API to support concurrency in Scala Native. This would be the core part of coding during the GSOC program. If finished before the end of the program, together with my mentor and the rest of contributors, I would look for other parts of the JDK API to implement.</p>\n",

Knowing execution time is a key to develop an accurate simulation in real-time areas. Precise measurement of execution time is important in area about life safety, such as military equipments, automotive and aerospace industries.\nAs we known, Matlab has a Profiler function which could measure where a program spends time. By using Matlab Profiler, we could evaluate and improve performance of programs. What I want to do is to make a similar function for Scilab.\nWe use Xcos to make models that have many blocks. In some cases, we want to know execution time of these blocks. A variety of literatures introduce the way of measuring execution time but they did not present directly time to users. Therefore, in this project, I will measure time and present time to users.</p>\n",

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Ideally, upstream component developers begin the process by supplying SPDX flies as part of their downloads. Users of those components therefore have a starting point for the SPDX files they create for their \"customers,\" and so on. If everything is working properly, the provenance of each piece of code is researched and documented only once during its journey through a supply chain, and that information is passed on in parallel with the code in the SPDX format.</p>\n<p>Execution</p>\n<p>Development of SPDX is run somewhat like an open source project: Those that participate influence. Decisions tend to be made by consensus. The spec itself is writen by a technical team with input and support from business and legal teams. Although much of the the initial focus was on Linux and the project is under the auspices of the Linux Foundation, the strategy from the outset has been much broader to be applicable to anything open source. To accommodate a range of needs, SPDX can be implemented in XML or tag-value formats.</p>\n<p>The SPDX \"IP\" is all housed on this site. Most of that is embodied in the spec itself, but we have developed a number of separate assets that complement the specification, including a standard license list, implementation guidelines and the SPDX compatible tools.</p>\n",

While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX.</p>\n<p>HPX (High Performance ParalleX) is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  This library strictly adheres to the C++11 Standard and leverages the Boost C++ Libraries which makes HPX easy to use, highly optimized, and very portable.  HPX is developed for conventional architectures including Linux-based systems, Windows, Mac, and the BlueGene/Q, as well as accelerators such as the Xeon Phi.</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>If you are looking for a project which incorporates cutting edge HPC research, runtime library development, and C++ standardization check out our <a href=\"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/GSoC-2017-Project-Ideas\" target=\"_blank\">ideas page</a> and contact us either though the #ste||ar channel on IRC (Freenode) or via an email at \n</p>\n",

The scale of problems and the amount of data available have made it infeasible to solve a meaningful problem in a single computer. As such, in such a scale, it is imperative to combine CPUs and accelerator cards such as GPUs to achieve one unified computing source. HPXCL aims at unifying kernel launch and data transfer into HPX asynchronous graph through seamless integration. However, the current implementation of the system with CUDA fails to achieve the desired performance improvement metrics while running in a cluster of computers. The proposal is aimed at improving the performance of CUDA-based HPXCL applications through an ‘Event’ triggered mechanism. Appropriate tests are also to be written to ensure necessary functionality performs as required. Standard benchmarking algorithms (Floyd Warshall, FFT etc.) will also be implemented in HPXCL, OpenCL and CUDA to validate, measure and improve the performance of the existing system, while also keeping in mind the new functionality added.</p>\n",

To address this requirement, “music block” has a user guide. But the existing user guide lacks most of the important information about the software components,  how each building blocks in the software can be related to music and especially some examples of how to create music with the software.

For finite FpGroups, this can be greatly extended by defining an isomorphism to a Permutation Group since the latter has much more functionality already implemented. This calls for the general implementation of group homomorphisms which in turn requires implementation of rewriting systems for groups. Another issue is infinite FpGroups for which better treatment can be provided, in particular, there are certain techniques that allow to determine if a group is infinite before passing it to a function that wouldn't be able to terminate successfully while processing an infinite group.</p>\n",

It is an implementation of more than 6000 rules to cover a wide variety of indefinite integration. Currently SymPy uses algorithms for indefinite integration which are too slow and presents results which are not simplified. Rubi utilizes a set of well defined rules which makes it smart to present the results in a more symmetric and simplified manner. The Pattern Matcher along with transformation rules plays an important role in making Rubi more robust and fast. As it works on the given set of rules, it can be modified easily to include more rules and cover more number of integrations.</p>\n",

It uses Python’s framework Django to handle the backend while bootstrap aides the frontend mechanism. The web application has the basic build up that includes interfaces for posts and contact information for both the aforesaid applications. The signup, login, post creating and editing pages have been given a decent makeup to start with. However, the code really needs a brush up as it is built using Django 1.6.5, having a somewhat messy structure that needs to be optimized and its user interface is lacking interesting features. One of the major motives of my GSoC would be to improve the existing code, to complete the things that are almost complete and to bring a sound and cogent change in the User Interface. Also, the new features I am adding aren't completely new, they are commonly used features only. By the end of GSoC, I want MACC to be production ready and available to use for a wider majority of people who can rely on its generic view to aide their own applications control.</p>\n",

To answer the needs of automotive industry in this manner with an open-source approach, recent studies have been made such as the Eclipse-based APP4MC platform. Although APP4MC provides sufficient tooling in parallel computing for automotive domain, the demonstration and evaluation of its results would improve its performance and allow to investigate the optimization of goals such as resource usage and energy consumption. With the project, software distribution challenges for such automotive systems should be analyzed upon instruction precise modeling, affinity constrained distribution, and reducing task response times achieved by advanced software parallelization.

The goal of this project is to create a framework for the creation of tree-based editors for JSON files based on a given JSON schema. The schema defines which elements and attributes are supported by the editor and how the tree can be structured. This information is parsed by the framework and a running editor is created based on this information. If required, additional editor-related features can be specified, e.g. which icons are used in the tree. The implementation will be based on the existing open source framework JSON Forms.</p>\n",

Usings the tools already built into Guile, this allows Guile to act as the full stack for small scale web sites, and provides a path for Guile based software like GNU Lilypond to be run on the web.</p>\n<p>It also provides further validation of Guile's Compiler Tower design, showing that backends can be written as easily as front ends.</p>\n<p>In a previous summer of code, I was able to compile a large portion of the cps language to Javascript and ported a large section of boot-9 (Guile's basic prelude), which meant I could run programs of some complexity, including using continuations for search, and mutually recursive numerical programs.

We accomplish this via:</p>\n<p>Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals &amp; organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.</p>\n<p>Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

To make things worse, there are malware using the sandbox-detection techniques in order to escape from being detected by automatic dynamic app testing services and attack real users only, according to a study from Kim, Mijoo, et al., 2016. As a result, three research questions can be raised:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>RQ1: What sandbox-detection techniques are applied in Android apps, and how and to what extent are they applied?</li>\n<li>RQ2: Is there a method capable of detecting such sandbox-detection techniques given a sample app?</li>\n<li>RQ3: Is there an app analysis solution undetectable by common sandbox-detection methods?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The goal of the Android sandbox detection and countermeasure project is solving the problems mentioned above. This can be separated into finer stages:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Investigating and collecting sandbox-detection techniques used in Android app (especially malware), and implementing a sample app using those techniques.</li>\n<li>Implementing a detection-aware system.</li>\n<li>Implementing an undetectable system.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Malware analytics is no longer the realm of the individual human analyst. \nThe amount of newly collected malware samples grows every year and there is no sign that this trend is nearing its peak. Defending and fighting against malicious attacks requires tools and techniques to recognize their origin, family, actor, purpose and modus operandi. In this project, I will develop a system that can use a wide range of malware analytic outputs (source code, DNS/ASN data, peinfo results, yara rules, IPs, domains etc.) to automatically detect relationships  between malicious objects in a database and assign a score to each detected relationship. This system should accept user requests for analytic jobs and utilize distributed machine learning techniques and tools in order to extract knowledge out of the malware-related Big Data available. The system output for the analyst should be a graphical representation of the generated results.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2017 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center,  Amazon Web Services, University of Texas at Austin, University of Texas at Dallas, Brigham Young University and the universities of London UK, Toronto CA, Tokyo JP, Basel CH, São Paulo BR, and Prague CZ.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

We will build a system, Java StarFinder (JSF), that enables users to describe properties of the data structures in the heap using separation logic. JSF is a symbolic execution engine, built on top of SPF, that generates path conditions (PCs) in the form of separation logic. These PCs are checked by a solver for satisfiability and test input generation. In addition, JSF can verify program correctness by collecting PCs satisfying some given preconditions and verifying if these PCs satisfy user-provided assertions.</p>\n",

Crucial to the efficiency of such tools, especially as parameter dimensions increase, are tools like HMC, which allow use differentiation and/or conjugacy for continuous parameters, so that fitting is not solely a matter of getting lucky with random Metropolis-Hastings proposals. Yet some models, especially nonparametric ones, also require discrete parameters and/or hand-written jump steps; and existing tools for HMC generally don't play well with discrete parameters. My project is intended to generally improve the Julia toolchain for MCMC when there is a mix of continuous and discrete parameters. My work will be based on Mamba.jl; though when I can make something that will be useful to Klara.jl too, even better. To make that plan concrete, I'll be implementing CrossCat, a general-purpose nonparametric model for \"medium-size\" tabular data including missingness and various data types. (Roughly speaking, \"medium-size\" might mean p&lt;1e3, n&lt;1e5).</p>\n",

The so-called “forward problem” that is the problem of solving differential equations for given parameter values in the differential equation models has been extensively studied by mathematicians, physicists, and engineers. However, the “inverse problem”, the problem of parameter estimation based on the measurements of output variables, has not been well explored using modern optimization and statistical methods. Parameter estimation aims to find the unknown parameters of the model which give the best fit to a set of experimental data. In this way, parameters which cannot be measured directly will be determined in order to ensure the best fit of the model with the experimental results. This will be done by globally minimizing an objective function which measures the quality of the fit. This inverse problem usually considers a cost function to be optimized (such as maximum likelihood). This problem has applications in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study.</p>\n",

Additionally it should enable Escher.jl to reuse much of Interact, which will likely reduce Escher’s size and complexity significantly, increasing its stability. Furthermore, by removing its dependence on Jupyter and IPywidgets, Interact will gain flexibility to produce more complex UIs which intermix displayed data such as plots, and UI controls.

Therefore there exists a need for extension so that other methods, such as ECDSA or EDDSA can be used easily. Implementation of RFC 7427 would solve this problem as the new digital signature method is flexible enough to include all current signature methods (RSA, DSA, ECDSA, RSASSA-PSS, etc.) and add new methods (ECGDSA, ElGamal, etc.) in the future.</p>\n",

But some NAT rules even drop the UDP packets, only allowing TCP streams to go through. TCP encapsulation can reach through to hosts behind such NATs. An initiator must always try to send IKE_SA_INIT over UDP first, and if there are a certain number of transmission fails then only it should fall back to TCP. Another thing to do would be to schedule checks for UDP so we can go to establishing the tunnel using UDP if it becomes available and tear down the TCP IPsec tunnel. The above two steps are to be done as TCP encapsulation adds overheads and has performance trade offs compared to UDP, therefore we should always prefer using UDP unless required otherwise. Once the TCP support is added, we need to look into enabling ESPinTCP support in the kernel. The kernel must be able to identify TCP packets where the first 4 bytes are zero and we must tell the kernel to process ESPinTCP packets. Everything else will be done by following the draft RFC draft-ietf-ipsecme-tcp-encaps-09.</p>\n",

This also includes building releases, testing them and debugging the system files (written in C) to make them work. Currently, Anita only has support for qemu (and experimental support for running NetBSD as Xen DomU). Unlike BSD, Linux has a kernel module known as KVM, which allows a user space program to utilize the hardware virtualization features of various processors and can be utilized by qemu to provide “KVM acceleration” when the target architecture is the same as host architecture. The lack of such support makes qemu really slow on NetBSD. Testing system installation on a wide variety of platforms is very crucial for any organisation that’s into OS business. It can be a frustrating task to do that manually, but, if neglected can be a make or break situation for the OS (adoption/marketing). Automated testing with Anita makes the job a cakewalk. Support for Xen and Virtualbox will further enhance the capabilities of Anita.</p>\n",

Users of <em>ns-3</em> can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in <em>ns-3</em> is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds.  Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.</p>\n<h3>Project details</h3>\n<p><em>ns-3</em> has been in development since 2006 and has made 26 releases (ns-3.26 in October 2016).  <em>ns-3</em> models are written in C++, with Python bindings and Python-based build tools.  The tool is in wide use in the field; we provide statistics about the project on our <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">web site</a>, but in summary, the community includes over 7000 people subscribed to our users forum, 1500 people subscribed to our developers mailing list, 200 recognized code contributors, and about 12 active maintainers.  The project's impact on the field is high:  the number of annual academic publications citing use of <em>ns-3</em> is an imprecise count but appears to range in the several hundreds per year based on our searching of IEEE and ACM digital libraries and Google Scholar.  We operate as an GPLv2 open source project with an associated consortium and steering committee to provide administrative support to the project.</p>\n",

Until today ns-3 – which aims to replace the aging ns2 and its associated old-featured simulators –  does not have even in its latest version a MIPv6 module that is fully compliant to the IETF specification. To fill this gap, I am going to implement a novel MIPv6 simulation model which can be integrated into ns-3.\nThe project idea aims at testing the code in different network scenarios, containing different link layer technologies such as Wi-Fi, WiMAX and LTE. The current implementation of LTE does not have support of IPv6 in ns-3. So, the idea of testing MIPv6 code into LTE would follow IPv6 support implementation in LTE first and then the MIPv6 support. So, ns-3 researchers can benefit themselves with the addition of this feature. \nThus, implementation of MIPv6 in ns-3 as the base mobility management solution and providing LTE support within it could help the current network researchers working on ns-3.</p>\n",

Although TCP Prague is still a work in progress, some related modules have been finalised and briefly experimented, such as: the Low Latency, Low Loss, Scalable throughput (L4S) service architecture, DualQ Coupled AQM, Modified ECN Semantics for Ultra Low Queueing Delay. Availability of these modules in network simulators like ns-3 is crucial to boost up the ongoing efforts of standardizing TCP Prague. In this project, the aim is to implement the above mentioned modules in ns-3. Additionally, the functionality of these modules will be tested, and the necessary documentation with some examples will also be provided.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>In PSNs, sometimes it is not possible to distinguish and manipulate different kinds of network flows. For example, we may want to give priority to some flows while limiting bandwidth of other flows or even perform packet classification. To solve such problems, we have a traffic control layer in ns-3 which intercepts the packets flowing between the L2 Net devices and any IP protocol. It uses several qdiscs like pfifo, HBT, RED, CoDel etc., in order to process these packets and perform scheduling or shaping. Currently the ns-3 traffic layer only contains traffic scheduling qdisc models (AQMs) and lacks realistic traffic shaping algorithms. This project aims to introduce the TBF and HHF algorithms into the ns-3 traffic control layer. TBF is a classless traffic shaper, that is used to control the flow rate or bandwidth of the throughput. HHF is a size-based qdisc that attempts to differentiate small and heavy flows. The goal is to catch the heavy flows and move them to a separate queue with less priority so that bulk traffic does not affect the latency of critical traffic.</p>\n",

Our goal is to empower people of all interests and backgrounds to learn how to program and make creative work with code, especially those who might not otherwise have access to these tools and resources.</p>\n<p>We do this by developing and distributing a group of related software projects, which includes <a href=\"http://processing.org\" target=\"_blank\">Processing (Java)</a>, <a href=\"http://p5js.org\" target=\"_blank\">p5.js (JavaScript)</a>, and <a href=\"http://py.processing.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Processing.py (Python)</a>, and facilitating partnerships and collaborations with allied organizations and individuals, to build a more diverse community around software and the arts.</p>\n<p>The Processing Foundation is specifically invested in expanding the communities of technology and the arts to include and support those who have not had equal access because of their race, gender, class, sexuality, and/or ability. We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.</p>\n<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skillset, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>\n",

ViSP allows to design vision-based tasks for eye-in-hand and eye-to-hand visual servoing that contains the most classical visual features that are used in practice. It involves a large set of elementary positioning tasks with respect to various visual features (points, segments, straight lines, circles, spheres, cylinders, image moments, pose...) that can be combined together, and image processing algorithms that allow tracking of visual cues (dots, segments, ellipses...) or 3D model-based tracking of known objects or template tracking. Simulation capabilities are also available.</p>\n<p>Releases as well as daily snapshots can be downloaded as source code tarball or zip.

Principles of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science\" target=\"_blank\">Open Science</a> are at the core of the scientific method.</p>\n<p>Most of the scholarly communication today is done as it was a hundred years ago. The data supporting the claims in the paper can be difficult to acquire or even impossible to find, software used to produce the results is a collection of scripts rotting-away on a laptop or a USB stick, while the paper itself, after it's been published, is kept behind a publisher's paywall, and is not easily accessible to everyone. The scientific community has yet to fully appreciate the lessons taught by the FOSS movement, and Zenodo[1] was built to make Open Science a reality for everyone.</p>\n<h3>What is Zenodo?</h3>\n<p>Zenodo is an open and free digital archive, allowing all researchers from around the world to publish their papers, data and software, which then can be cited, accessed, analyzed and reproduced by anyone. Zenodo is built by the researchers and software engineers at <a href=\"http://home.cern/\" target=\"_blank\">CERN</a> in collaboration with <a href=\"https://www.openaire.eu/\" target=\"_blank\">OpenAIRE</a>, sharing passion for Open Source and Open Science. Zenodo is both a free and public <a href=\"https://zenodo.org\" target=\"_blank\">service</a>, as well as Free and Open Source <a href=\"http://zenodo.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\">Software</a>, based on <a href=\"http://invenio.readthedocs.io\" target=\"_blank\">Invenio</a> - a general purpose digital library platform, and also a FOSS developed and used by CERN as well as other institutions worldwide. By contributing to Zenodo you will also contribute to Invenio, so not only will you aid Open Science, but also many other scientific institutes and academic libraries around the world!</p>\n<p>[1] The name, Zenodo, is derived from <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zenodotus\" target=\"_blank\">Zenodotus</a>, the first librarian of the Ancient Library of Alexandria and father of the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history.</p>\n",

Also the load on committers/reviewers drops down drastically with this as obvious bugs fail to pass the automatic testing phase and alerting the developers that something has gone wrong before they ask for reviews.

It is easy to get started, I used it to contact mentors, discuss in the community etc. I have also deployed a local server in my hostel wing. It resulted in complete success to do various discussions. The best part is you never miss a message even if a server has thousands of users; unread counts are managed, get email and desktop notifications. It’s like impossible to miss a single message even after long vacations.
