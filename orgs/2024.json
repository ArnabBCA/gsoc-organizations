          "abstract_html": "The enviroCar Android app provides capabilities for visualizing user related tracks within a map. For this feature, the app makes use of several libraries of the Mapbox mapping framework. However, recent changes in the terms-of-use of Mapbox as well as their switch to a non open-source license makes it problematic to continue relying on Mapbox.\n\nMapLibre Native library for Android is an open-source alternative to Mapbox mapping\nframework. Migrating to MapLibre will ensure the project's adherence to open-source principles & long-term sustainability.\n\nMapbox's current issues are preventing many developers in the open-source community from participating in the further development of the enviroCar app. Thus, this project aims to add support for multiple map providers (primarily MapLibre) into the enviroCar Android application. This will be done by introducing a new extensible and independent map module into the project's source-code. This map module will allow the users to select the preferred map provider/library based on their requirements, both during compile-time and run-time of the application.",

          "abstract_html": "OGC SensorThings API is an international standard to eliminate vendor lock-ins in IoT systems and to create an open geospatial ecosystem by defining a standard data model and describe how to retrieve the ingested data. However, the standard by itself does not specify a way to physically store the data. Most of the current server implementations are all based on Postgres databases using the PostGIS extension. Unfortunately, relational databases are not a great choice to store large volumes of data, which is often the case with IoT applications. As a result, retrieving large volumes of data from any of the open source SensorThings API servers is painfully slow.\n\nModern data lakehouse standards and cloud-native geospatial file formats offer a scalable, modular, cost-effective and a much faster way to store and work with large volumes of geospatial data on the web. Specifically, Apache Iceberg is an open table format for organizing data lakes in object stores and ensuring ACID guarantees. GeoParquet is a cloud-native geospatial file encoding, based on a columnar data storage format for tabular data that significantly compresses the data and improves querying efficiency. \n\nA cloud native SensorThings API extension using Apache Iceberg could significantly enhance the standard's ability to ingest and aggregate large heterogeneous streams of sensor data. The proposal hence puts forth a design architecture for any SensorThings API server to use Iceberg to store and retrieve sensor data in a more efficient manner reducing memory overhead and network latencies when retrieving such data over the web. Eventually, as GeoParquet gets merged into Iceberg, the implementation will support a much faster alternative to existing SensorThings API implementations for handling sensor data at scale.",

Accurately predicting coastal changes is crucial for adaptation, but current methods overlook dynamic factors like declining sea ice and variations in tidal, temperature, and energy wave data. To enhance coastal modeling, more digitized coastlines are needed due to the inefficiency of manual interpretation. The project aims to develop an automated system for extracting coastlines from PlanetLab images by using techniques like Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) thresholding and DeepWaterMap algorithms. The main challenge is developing the NDWI index, a method for image labeling for the training data, specifically the thresholding value for the label. While also considering other preprocessing algorithms for atmospheric correction, mosaicking, etc. Additionally, devising a robust validation method that considers temporal variation is crucial. The project aims to have a model that automatically extracts a vectorized coastline representation from PlanetLabs satellite imagery with high accuracy.",

The second method analyzes the direction and speed of the fire spread by calculating optical flow vectors.\nForest rangers will receive actionable insights in real-time, including the area, direction and speed of fire spread, along with the count and location of fire spots, the distance between spots, and alarm functionalities to facilitate quick decision-making. These insights will be geo-referenced using drone flight data, providing accurate coordinates for targeted intervention and containment efforts.\n\nSet of Deliverables:\n- An optimized fire detection model capable of accurately identifying fire spots.\n- Parameters and algorithms for calculating severity based on fire detection data.\n- A comprehensive system for providing real-time actionable insights to forest rangers, enabling them to make informed decisions and respond promptly to forest fire incidents.",

With the Instant Note Editor, users will be able to effortlessly add a Cloze-type note in half the time it currently takes without actually opening the app but a dialog. Here the user will be able to share selected text and instantly turn a word to cloze just by single taping it.\nAnkiDroid allows user to add media to the cards via multimedia attachment option but the steps required in the process are sometimes misleading and the code of the activity is tightly coupled making it difficult to maintain, this project will decouple the UI and its logic and improvise the UX.

          "abstract_html": "I propose to augment the current project by implementing pending pipeline features which will drastically improve the security and capability of the base application.\n\nSpecifically I propose implementing secure RSA encryption to the messaging service, implement secure file sharing with audio and video support and enable user discovery on a WiFi network using UIDs\n\nRSA encryption\nI propose using the rsa_encrypt library in dart to secure the chat service being created between two clients on the same peer network. When two clients are connected on the same peer network, a connection is created using FPTP protocol. This project proposes to use rsa_encrypt to create a security layer over the FPTP layer. Hence the chat service is secure from other possible listeners on the peer network.\n\nSecure file sharing\nI propose to extend the messaging service with file sharing capabilities. We transcribe the file stored in the client’s local storage into raw metadata and securely stream the bytes to the connected client using the RSA encryption layer. The client checks for the file type using MIMETypes and decodes the bytes into the intended file. This implementation is expected to use the dart:convert library for encoding and decoding. The challenge which I aim to surpass is encoding the raw bytes through the RSA layer to ensure that unauthorized listeners cannot access the raw bytes.\n\nFile Viewing\nI propose to implement in app file previews for supported file types using open-file-x and also enable in app viewing for image and video file types.\n\nUser Discovery on a Local Network\nThe challenge here would be for the application to persist UIDs which can be advertised over the WiFi network. Flutter does not have the capability to access users connected to a WiFi network unless the application is the router. Hence I propose to use mDNS to allow the devices to broadcast their presence on the same network without needing a central server.",

This can lead to anyone fake their votes or launch attacks that can make voting very difficult for others.\nSet of deliverables: Mitigate vulnerabilities like re-entrancy and fake votes in Diamond Proxy through encryption and frequent security evaluations.\n2. Cross-Chain Interoperability:\nProblems: The current Dapp only allows voting on 1 specific blockchain this can restrict user accessibility and reliability.\nSet of deliverables: Enabling cross chain interoperability will allow users to vote from any blockchain.\n3. Web3 Database Implementation:\nProblems: The current implementation charges very high gas fee for creation and interaction with elections.\nSet of deliverables: Reduce on-chain data storage, optimizing performance and scalability while maintaining data integrity. Also removes the barrier to pay gas for registering in Dapp.\n4. Expansion of Voting Algorithms: \nProblem: Limited algorithms result in a lack of proper representation of views and give lesser choices to organizers. \nSet of deliverables: Adding diverse voting algorithms like ranked choice and quadratic voting.\n5. ERC1155 for Voter Proof: \nProblem: Users currently have no proof of participation in an election and no section in Dapp to check for their voted elections.\nSet of deliverables:By minting an NFT for each vote cast, users will have verifiable evidence of their participation in voting.\n6. Adding Hashing to Voting system:\nProblem: The current voting system lacks privacy since voting details can be traced through blockchain transactions.\nSet of deliverables: Implementing argument hashing to ensure the anonymity of votes, thereby preventing the disclosure of any user's voting choices.",

VirtioFS is an extension of the Virtio standard specifically crafted for file system sharing between VMs and the host. This is particularly beneficial in scenarios where seamless access to shared files and data between VMs and the host is essential. VirtioFS has been widely adopted in virtualization technologies such as QEMU and Kata Container.\n\nApache OpenDAL is a data access layer that allows users to easily and efficiently retrieve data from various storage services in a unified manner. In this project, our goal is to reference virtiofsd (a standard vhost-user backend, a pure Rust implementation of VirtioFS based on the local file system) and implement VirtioFS based on OpenDAL.\n\nThrough this project, VMs can access numerous data services through the file system interface with the assistance of the OpenDAL service daemon deployed on the host, all without their awareness. It ensures the efficiency of file system reading and writing in VMs through VirtioFS support. This storage-system-as-a-service approach conceals the details of the distributed storage system from VMs. This ensures the security of storage services, as VMs do not need to be aware of the information, configuration and permission credentials of the accessed storage service. Additionally, it enables the utilization of a new backend storage system without reconfiguring all VMs.",

To tackle these issues, the plan includes:\n1. Upgrading Dubbo-python to support Python 3 and modernizing its architecture following the Microkernel + Plugin design principle.\n2. Implementing complete RPC communication functionality, including server-side service exposure and client-side service invocation, with support for the new Triple protocol.\n3. Developing service governance capabilities such as service discovery, registration, and load balancing, including the design of a GPU metric-based load balancing algorithm to address GPU workload imbalances in AI frameworks.\n4. Writing comprehensive test codes to ensure the reliability of each functionality and providing detailed documentation to facilitate easier adoption and contribution to Dubbo-python.\nBy accomplishing these objectives, the aim is to transform Dubbo-python into a robust, high-performance RPC framework compatible with mainstream AI frameworks, thus empowering developers to build scalable and efficient AI systems.",

Currently, the engine utilizes off-heap memory in most OLTP algorithms, but lacks the ability to control memory allocation per individual query, leading to potential out-of-memory (OOM) errors. The project aims to design and implement a unified memory management framework to address this limitation. This framework will include features such as lifecycle management of memory objects, memory capacity restrictions, and an allocator interface for efficient memory allocation and release. By implementing this framework, the project is expected to improve the stability and performance of the hugegraph-server, ultimately enhancing its usability and reliability for users.",

We will first develop an Airavata MFT Node SDK similar to the existing Python SDK. The Electron app and the Jupyter extension will then be built on top of this Node SDK.

The suggested set of transforms to be implemented are: \n1. RunInference\n2. ReadFromSpanner\n3. WriteToSpanner\n4. Enrichment Transforms\n\nI also want to add three use cases for the Yaml API, providing end-to-end pipelines demonstrating the use of the newly implemented transforms. The suggested use cases are:\n1. Text processing with MLTransform and RunInference\n2. Processing tabular data from Spanner\n3. Enriching tabular customer data with Enrichment Transform. \n\nBy expanding the capabilities of the Yaml API, the goal is to streamline the process of constructing and managing data pipelines using Apache Beam. This improvement will enable users to tackle a wider array of data processing tasks with greater ease and efficiency, potentially attracting a broader audience to leverage Apache Beam for their data processing needs.",

          "abstract_html": "Apache Beam through its unified model for batch and streaming data-parallel processing pipelines, runners for executing them on a variety of distributed processing backends and ML specialized transforms within MLTransform (such as EmbeddingManager  and other MLTransformProvider) make it uniquely positioned for building out RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) based applications. These applications are one of the most useful and commonly being built applications on LLMs (Large Language Models).\n\nFor this project we will focus on building a knowledge base on a vector database for a text corpus, and enriching user's questions with matching text chunks using semantic search. This is a crucial part of any RAG applications and helps us in building the right prompt context for LLMs. \n\nWe will implement the following deliverables to achieve this:\n\n1. Build a Beam pipeline that takes in a batch text corpus from a public dataset as parameter to pipeline and uses MLTransform to generate and save Embeddings in batch mode to a vector database.\n- Initial scope: Wikipedia dataset with JinaAI Embeddings read from object storage and written to RedisIO to publish to known vector DB.\n\n2. Build a Beam pipeline that takes in stream of text questions from clients and enriches it with related texts from the vector DB.\n- Initial scope: KafkaIO based reading of queries which is populated by producers independently and published in a different topic for results.\n\n3. New enrichment handlers for vector database queries over Redis based Vector DB\n\nStretch goals:\n\n1. Implement enrichment handlers for OpenSearch (AWS supported)[4]\n2. Implement enrichment handlers for Vertex AI Vector Search (GCP Supported)[5]\n\n\nThe goal is to demonstrate semantic search building capabilities trivially using Beam and hence evaluation of search results is not tied to a broad benchmark (such as MTEB) for this project's scope.",

Rust, known for its safety and memory integrity, is seen as a promising solution to address vulnerabilities in IoT systems, such as buffer overflows and memory corruption. The project involves studying Rust for embedded systems and \"no_std\" environments, creating coding guidelines for Rust in NuttX, and developing a guide for these standards. It starts with converting simple NuttX applications, like the LED Blinky App, to Rust, gradually moving to more complex applications.\n\nThe deliverables include implementing Embedded Rust, C Interoperability, and Heap Memory Allocation in Rust, porting the LED Blinky App from C to Rust, and testing it on various Single-Board Computers. The project also aims to merge these items into NuttX Mainline as Pull Requests and add workarounds for NuttX's rustc build process. Documentation will cover a coding standard for Rust, setting up a local environment for Rust build, configuring NuttX to work with Rust, and building Rust firmware with NuttX.",

As a Master's student studying Data Science and Computer Science at the University of Pennsylvania, I am eager to explore the intricacies of event-driven architectures further, particularly by deepening my contributions to the AsyncAPI community. \n\nMy ambition is to transition from a role of simply contributing code to assuming the responsibilities of a project maintainer for the AsyncAPI Generator, a key instrument for facilitating documentation and code generation based on the AsyncAPI specification. This commitment aims to not just contribute technically but also to foster community engagement and ensure the longevity of the project. In this new role as a maintainer, I plan to review and improve documentation, handle incoming requests, engage in community discourse, assist new contributors, and spearhead the implementation of innovative features, complete with testing. Additionally, I will document my path to becoming a maintainer, the challenges faced, and the insights gained, culminating in a roadmap for future maintainers. This endeavor is not only a testament to my commitment to enhancing the AsyncAPI project but also an opportunity to contribute to the sustainability and enrichment of the broader open-source community. Leveraging my technical skills, demonstrated in a recent project that achieved a 20% performance increase using React.js and Redux, and my proactive participation in AsyncAPI discussions and enhancements, I am prepared to undertake this significant shift.",

At the project's core is difflogic, a recent technique that employs sparsely-connected network composed of basic logic gates to obtain small models and fast inference. The core goal of the project is to enable a convenient workflow for developing difflogic models and running them on the Bela, with an expected workflow of developing and training models on a larger machine, followed by exporting the model to C and cross-compiling it for the BeagleBone - either the main CPU or the PRUs. To support this, I will develop wrappers for exporting compiled difflogic models for use in the languages supported on Bela (C++, Pure Data, SuperCollider, Csound).\n\nI will then build out integrations and applications of difflogic for the rapid development of useful audio models, exploring the possibilities for combining difflogic networks with DDSP (differentiable digital signal processing) and cheap/lightweight techniques and toolkits, \"porting\" well-known ML architectures to difflogic networks, and training difflogic networks to approximate the behavior of existing neural networks (knowledge distillation). I will develop example applications involving sound analysis, classification, and synthesis, and experiment with interactive machine learning.\n\nFinally, I will apply these techniques to a creative application inspired by work on bytebeat and sound matching: generating networks of logic gates to approximate sounds and exploring the space of such sound-generating networks. I will train difflogic gates to reproduce particular sounds, treating the entire network as a bytebeat-style audio-generating function of time.\nLastly, I will build an interactive application to explore the space of sound-generating networks (e.g. by mutating or morphing networks) and visualize the execution of logic gate networks.",

With the introduction of the Metal Viewport, features such as HDR support and development support from Apple, Blender can now be easily regarded as one of the best 3D applications available for the Mac. However, when it comes to its user interface, Blender still doesn’t feel quite properly integrated within the macOS environment. This GSoC proposal aims to change this, with the goal of making Blender feel closer to a fully native macOS application.\n\nThis proposal plans to improve the Blender macOS user experience by incorporating part of the Blender interface into the macOS interface. Effectively making it closer to the macOS Human Interface Guidelines, and providing macOS Blender users with a familiar experience, more tightly integrated into their operating system.\n\nTo achieve this goal, this proposal will focus on the improvements of two main UI elements: the macOS menu bar and title bar. While this proposal will focus on macOS implementation, a byproduct of it will be the creation of an unified interface for native menu bar items, which will then make it possible to implement such functionality on other OS and Desktop Environments in the future.",

          "abstract_html": "In Blender, geometry nodes provide the user with a visual scripting interface to manipulate 3D geometry, allowing the creation of custom modifiers and procedural tools. In most cases, the input of geometry nodes is the source geometry to which the geometry node is attached. File import nodes would allow more source data to be fed into geometry nodes, expanding the use case for geometry nodes. \nCurrently, Blender has source nodes for primitive shapes, allowing the user to inject more geometric data into the geometry nodes graph. The user can inject data into the geometry node graph with dedicated file import nodes. \n\nDynamically loading file formats like STL, OBJ, Alembic, and CSV with a geometry node would simplify everyday data visualization tasks. Also, it would reduce memory consumption on disks because the data would not have to be stored in a .blend file.\n\nAs part of this year's Google Summer of Code, I'll be aiming to deliver the following\n1) Multiple file import nodes for STL, OBJ, Alembic, PLY, and CSV formats\n2) Refactoring for existing bf_io_* projects to expose Mesh loading functions\n3) New importer project for CSV import support\n4) Technical and user documentation Integrated tests",

These libraries provide pre-written functions and modules that can significantly accelerate the development process by offering pre-built components for common design elements, gears, fasteners, and more. However, discovering and integrating these libraries remains challenging, especially for new users. \n\nCurrently, OpenSCAD lacks a dedicated library manager. This project proposes a solution by creating a simple and user-friendly OpenSCAD Library Manager. This project aims to significantly enhance the workflow for OpenSCAD users, allowing them to focus on design and innovation while leveraging the power of reusable components.",

WebGPU, a modern web standard and API, provides low-level, high-performance access to a device's GPU through web browsers. It aims to enable developers to create complex graphical applications and experiences on the web by utilizing modern GPU hardware for efficient graphics rendering. Due to their extensive usage and customized optimizations, current Federated Learning (FL) systems frequently concentrate on certain device types, such as smartphones or Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Nevertheless, FL's adaptability to other device kinds may be limited by this device-centric optimization, necessitating substantial coding and redesign work to modify FL systems for diverse device types. Because developers wind up building different and fragmented codebases for each device, this method violates software engineering principles of code reusability, making maintenance more difficult and impeding the effective deployment of FL. In this proposal, a novel WebGPU based federated learning network for heterogeneous device network is proposed. The proposal aims to deliver a working federated learning system supported by web browsers along with additional features.",

The major purpose is to compile complete data points from multiple sources, add to the dataset, and make it publicly available. The proposal identifies obstacles in correlating commit IDs to CVEs and proposes using timing analysis, NLP approaches, and real-time monitoring to address these issues. The project is separated into two stages: collecting data for existing commits and CVEs and making the system real-time. The implementation strategy involves data collection, correlation algorithm creation, integration of NLP techniques and offline LLM models, and real-time system installation.

          "abstract_html": "Users often encounter calls, SMS messages, and links across various mobile platforms, including browsers, social media, and messaging apps. However, when doubts arise regarding the legitimacy of these communications, such as suspicions of phishing attacks or the presence of malicious links, users currently lack a dedicated platform for submitting and reviewing such content. This absence of a centralized platform leaves users vulnerable to potential threats, as they lack a reliable mechanism to report and verify suspicious communications. Consequently, there is a pressing need for the development of a dedicated platform where users can submit calls, SMS messages, and links for review by trusted authorities or community members. Such a platform would empower users to proactively address security concerns, enhance collective awareness of potential threats, and contribute to the creation of a safer digital environment for all mobile users. \n\nTo address this pressing issue, we propose the development of a comprehensive mobile application equipped with automatic detection capabilities tailored to identify and mitigate spams and scams. In addition to its automated features, the application empowers users to manually contribute instances of suspicious content encountered on diverse platforms, fostering a community-driven approach to combating online fraud. Complementing the mobile app, a dedicated web application will cater to administrative users, providing them with the tools and resources needed to conduct thorough reviews of reported instances. Through a systematic review process, pertinent information about identified spams and scams will be meticulously documented and stored in a secure database, facilitating further analysis and informing future detection strategies.",

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\nThe public instance of cBioPortal (https://cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 4,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012 & Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013 have been cited more than 5,600 and 5,100 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe.\n\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands.",

And cBioPortal includes OncoKB annotation in it's view to provide detailed biological effect and clinical implications for each variant. Despite the availability of a standard API for annotating alterations, users without a computational background still find it challenging to annotate their variants. This project addresses this gap by first developing a pipeline to fetch a list of genomic variants from the MSK-IMPACT clinical cohort that have not been curated by OncoKB. The approach utilizes distributed parallel computing to accelerate the identification of target variants while ensuring data consistency through regular monitoring and timely updates. Then, a web interface has been designed to allow users to view and annotate these uncurated variants directly from the webpage. This interface supports searching and sorting functionalities, enabling users to find specific variants and prioritize them for OncoKB curation. The outcome of this initiative includes an automated pipeline, powered by AirFlow, for the continuous retrieval and verification of uncurated variants, alongside a user-friendly interface that facilitates the direct annotation of variants by users through webpage interactions. This project aims to simplify the variant annotation process, making it more accessible to a broader audience and further advancing the field of precision oncology.",

          "abstract_html": "My project aims to bridge the gap between single-cell gene expression data analysis and existing cancer genomics workflows, particularly within the cBioPortal platform. Currently, cBioPortal lacks support for visualizing single-cell data alongside bulk genomics data, hindering researchers from gaining a comprehensive understanding of cancer biology. To address this, I propose the development of a dedicated single-cell analysis module within cBioPortal, focusing on the MSK Spectrum dataset.\n\nThe key problem I am addressing is the inability to integrate single-cell gene expression data with existing cancer genomics workflows. By incorporating single-cell data into cBioPortal, researchers will be empowered to identify specific cells with altered gene expression, understand their contribution to overall expression patterns, and connect this information with genetic alterations.\n\nMy solution involves developing a custom Single-Cell Tab within cBioPortal's study view. The tab will include features such as dataset information, gene selection, interactive visualizations (boxplots, scatter plots, stacked bar graphs, and pie charts), filtering options, and download capabilities.\n\nTo achieve this, I will aggregate the single-cell data to a gene-cell type-sample level, creating a pseudo bulk representation to manage the large dataset size effectively. I will utilize existing charting libraries like CanvasJS and React primitives for visualization components, ensuring seamless integration with cBioPortal's design language.\n\nMy deliverables include:\n\nCustom Single-Cell Tab within cBioPortal study view.\nDataset information panel for study description and cell type/sample details.\nGene selection panel with autocomplete functionality.\nInteractive visualizations including boxplots, scatter plots, stacked bar graphs, and pie charts.\nFiltering options for focused data exploration.\nDownload options for data and plots in common file formats.",

It is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it.\n\nIf you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.\n\nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.\n\nIn addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: support, AI, rclone, cloud, flutter, peer-to-peer and a few more that are starting to take shape.\n\nThe best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics & technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.\n\nWe’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 9th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment.

Specifically, they offer resilience against broker outages, which is vital for system stability. However, the use of RADOS queues to support persistent notifications comes with its drawbacks. Not only does it impose additional strain on the RADOS cluster, but it also renders the system non-functional in environments lacking a RADOS backend.\nIn this project we propose the implementation of persistent bucket notifications within the RADOS Gateway, leveraging a Redis Queue instead. This approach offers several advantages, including compatibility with various backends such as posix, dbstore, and daos, facilitated by integrating with the \"zipper\" project. As a result, we can achieve robust bucket notifications while enhancing versatility across different storage environments.",

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

In particular, diffusion models have emerged as highly accurate, but the standard formulation of the diffusion process suffers from slow inference speeds. This project aims to accelerate the inference of diffusion models by exploring recently proposed techniques in the field, such as distillation, continuous-time diffusion formulations, or more efficient architectures.

Because of a variety of  features, ROOT is a very large software which takes a very long time to compile. Currently ROOT compiles all of the components available within the source code distribution. \r\nThe goal of the project is to speed up the compilation process by letting users specify which components of the ROOT will be needed. This can be done by converting ROOT’s CMake configuration into a set of “CMake External Projects” (superbuilds).  Superbuilds can remove all of this cruft from the project’s source repository, and enable you to more directly use the upstream project’s build system as an independently built software component. It is basically a simple package manager that you make consistently work across your target build platforms, and if your target platforms have a common package manager you might consider using that instead. \r\nAlso, during the configuration process it could be possible to identify if ROOT is already installed in the destination folder, the components which are already installed and offer an option to skip their compilation and use these already installed components for current compilation.\r\nWe are not going to change the build system of ROOT, but to optimize it and offer users an option to select only  the parts of the ROOT to  be built. Partial  builds for ROOT can allow the creation of “edition” builds if necessary.",

This initiative is motivated by the computational demands of particle physics, especially those associated with the Large Hadron Collider, which necessitates efficient and reliable software deployment across a massive, globally distributed computing grid. CVMFS (CernVM File System) plays a pivotal role in this process, serving as an optimized, POSIX-compliant read-only file system designed for user space via FUSE modules, thus facilitating software distribution.\nI propose replacing the current MacFUSE module as kernel extensions facing deprecation by Apple, with FUSE-T, a user-space module claimed to be a drop-in replacement. This transition addresses the issues with kernel extensions (kexts) and aligns with Apple's shift towards prohibition of support for them.  Such approach potentially seems to be the most user-friendly in terms of security.\nThe project involves various stages, including adapting CVMFS to use FUSE-T, benchmarking file operations, and investigating libfuse's new features like FUSE_CAP_SPLICE_MOVE. \nDeliverables include the successful integration of FUSE-T into CVMFS, benchmark reports on file operations, and an evaluation of libfuse updates.",

The notion of General Purpose GPU Programming is becoming more and more popular and it seems that the scientific community is increasingly favoring it over CPU Programming. Consequently, implementation of mathematics and operations needed for such projects are getting adjusted to GPU’s architecture. \nAutomatic differentiation is a notable concept in this context, finding applications across diverse domains from ML to Finance to Physics. Clad is a clang plugin for automatic differentiation that performs source-to-source transformation and produces a function capable of computing the derivatives of a given function at compile time. This project aims to widen Clad’s use range and audience by enabling the reverse-mode automatic differentiation of CUDA kernels.\nThe total goal of the project is to support the differentiation of CUDA kernels that may also include typical CUDA built-in objects (e.g. threadIdx, blockDim etc.), which are employed to prevent race conditions, using Clad. These produced kernels will compute the derivative of an argument specified by the user as the output based on an input parameter of their choosing.

          "abstract_html": "At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), protons collide at the highest energies achieved by humanity, unravelling the particles within. To decode these collisions, scientists rely on parton density functions (PDFs), which shed light on the proton's internal makeup. \n\nThese PDFs are called millions of times in the creation of every simulated event dataset at the LHC, highlighting the necessity for improved visualization tools. Given that PDFs play a critical role yet introduce significant uncertainty in LHC research, there's a need for tools that offer clearer and more precise analysis. \n\nWe propose to develop a web dashboard and a live plotting tool focused on vizualizing PDFs. This setup will facilitate the comparison of various PDF fits and their uncertainty margins, which are crucial for the accurate interpretation of LHC results. \nOur motivation is driven by the dual role of PDFs: as indispensable tools for simulation in LHC research and as major sources of uncertainty. \n\nEnhancing visualization capabilities will allow physicists to deeply explore the differences between PDF fits and their uncertainty-variations, aiding in more accurate interpretations of LHC data.",

Particles emerging from collisions create cascades of secondary particles, or showers. Describing these processes requires precise simulation methods like the Geant4 toolkit. Machine learning (ML) techniques, such as generative modeling, offer a promising alternative. Recently, the Fast Calorimeter Simulation Challenge (CaloChallenge) spurred the development and evaluation of different models. Also, in High-Energy Physics (HEP), there has been an increasing interest in using Julia as a language for software development, for combining the ease of programming of interactive languages, e.g. Python, with the speed of compiled languages, e.g. C++. This project targets to assess Julia's machine learning ecosystem's maturity, in terms of availability and robustness of libraries and tools for deep learning. To this end, a selection of models from the CaloChallenge will be chosen for implementation in Julia, as well as the required functionality to enable training and evaluation of the networks. Ultimately, a comprehensive analysis will be conducted between Python/C++ and Julia implementations, considering training time, inference time and evaluation metrics from CaloChallenge.",

The current flat list view lacks the ability to view all bookmarks at once, leading to user dissatisfaction. To solve this, we will transform the compact view into a tree view while retaining all new features introduced in the recent UI overhaul. This will involve retaining drag-and-drop functionality for bookmark organization within the tree view, ensuring compatibility with screen readers, and conducting comprehensive testing for usability and accessibility.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n1. Implement tree view functionality in the bookmarks side panel, allowing users to view all bookmarks at once.\n2. Update existing drag and drop functionality for organizing bookmarks within the tree view.\n3. Ensure accessibility standards are met, focusing on tab traversal and screen reader support.\n4. Conduct thorough testing to ensure the usability, accessibility, and functionality of the tree view.\n5. Prepare comprehensive documentation detailing the implementation, usage, and features of the new tree view in Chrome's bookmarks side panel.",

The migration requires minor changes to the original code structure. However, agent-side performance degrades significantly by around 50% according to cstyan’s experimental results. While manually serializing the data structure can avoid these allocation overheads, we prefer not to maintain hand-written marshal/unmarshal code. The upcoming Remote-write-2.0 (rw2.0) will address these memory allocation overheads. By pushing for rw2.0 alongside migrating to vtproto, we can utilize a better-maintained library and eliminate this allocation if rw2.0 is adopted quickly. Therefore, I propose that we manually marshal/unmarshal protobuf while pushing for rw2.0's publication.",

This approach allows developers to focus solely on their source code, while Knative Functions handles all underlying transformations, ensuring seamless execution across various platforms.\n\nWebAssembly (WASM) significantly enhances performance, security, and flexibility. By compiling code written in languages such as C, C++, Rust, and Go into a bytecode format, WebAssembly ensures consistent execution across different processor architectures (x86, ARM, RISC-V). WASM’s fast execution and platform-independent bytecode format could expand the capabilities of Knative Functions, supporting a broader range of programming languages and processor architectures.\n\nCurrently, there is no support for WASM in Knative Functions, which is why our project focused on pushing the boundaries of what’s possible by exploring WebAssembly support in Knative. During this project, we identified some limitations in fully integrating WASM into Knative Functions. However, by successfully implementing WASM support in Knative Serving, we were able to explore the potential of WASM within Knative and lay the groundwork for future improvements once these limitations are addressed.",

These policies will enable users to efficiently manage checkpoint resources, preventing operational challenges and resource exhaustion.\n\nProblem Statement:\n\nCurrent container checkpoint management lacks advanced and flexible garbage collection policies. This results in operational inefficiencies and resource wastage.\n\nProposed Solution:\n\nEnhance the existing Kubernetes operator with advanced garbage collection policies. These policies will empower users to define how checkpoints are managed at different levels (global, per-namespace, per-pod, per-container), ensuring efficient resource utilization and preventing operational challenges.\n\nKey Deliverables:\n\nGarbage Collection Policies:\n1. Implement dynamic checkpoint threshold policy for fine-grained control over checkpoint management.\n2. Introduce orphaned checkpoint cleanup policy to remove obsolete checkpoints.\n3. Implement time-based checkpoint retention policy for automatic deletion of outdated checkpoints.\n\nAutomated Checkpoint Management (Optional):\n1. Automate checkpoint lifecycle management, including creation, replacement, and deletion.\n2. Enforce storage quotas and monitor storage utilization.\n3. Collect metrics, enable alerting, and implement event logging for proactive management.\n\nImpact:\n\nThe implementation of these garbage collection policies will enable users to manage different container's(pod's, namespace's) checkpoint with different garbage collection policies. It will optimize resource utilization, and enhance operational efficiency.\n\nNote: Optional functionalities such as automated checkpoint management will be considered based on available time and project priorities.",

Several APIs from the OkHttp package are used, to make asynchronous requests. This implementation passes the conformance tests in package:http_client_conformance_tests. This plugin is expected to be able to stream response bodies as well. \n\nThe plugin will also implement the package:web_socket_channel's WebSocketChannel interface. \nThis will provide several features requested by Dart Users: \n(a) Support for KeyStore PrivateKeys (#50669), \n(b) Support for the system proxy (#50434), \n(c) Support for user-installed certificates (#50435). \nThe plugin should be available as a standalone package at https://pub.dev/.  \nIt should be almost identical to cronet_http and java_http packages, and provide seamless integration in all Flutter Projects. This package is also expected to broaden its functionality to other platforms.",

By enhancing CI/CD and automating testing procedures, it will significantly reduce the team's time investment in the validation phase of the development cycle for the cloud system. \n\nThis not only ensures the reliability and accuracy of D4CG platform’s data but also enables researchers to utilize this data to advance cancer research and increase opportunities for discovery.",

Since the release of stretch, Debian has incorporated core Android SDK tools, enabling the creation of certain apps. The Debian Android Tools team is dedicated to integrating the complete Android toolchain and SDK into Debian, facilitating the development of Android apps using exclusively free software packaged in user-friendly formats. Collaborating with the Debian Java team, this initiative addresses common tools like gradle used in Java software development. Recognizing the enormity of packaging the entire Android SDK, the team's focus extends to specific use cases, such as APK analysis tools and simplified setup of standalone components beneficial to non-Android developers, including the Emulator and NDK. Together with projects like Replicant, this endeavor aims to transform Android, the world's most popular operating system, into a fully Free Software platform.\nThe project's deliverables primarily encompass the completion and submission of finalized packages to Debian sid, encompassing both newly created packages and updated ones. Furthermore, efforts will be made to ensure the submission and integration of patches upstream in the Android sources whenever feasible.",

I will identify key functions to benchmark for, and key parameters to benchmark with. Those parameters may be: function input, such as benchmarking for nontrivial data, or for the cluster environment, such as the number of nodes, or implementations of the dependencies (e.g. BLAS), or the allowed deviation from expected benchmark metric (e.g. running time) before a regression is said to occur. Cluster tests will be configured for execution on the Grid5000 network (https://www.grid5000.fr/) in partnership with project mentor and Debian developer Prof. Drew Parsons. The FEniCS suite of packages for finite element computation will be used as a target case study to develop test protocols. The protocols will then be applied to a selection of other parallelised packages.\n\nFinally I will report the information in web pages for ease of consumption.\n\nTo enable more exhaustive testing of Debian parallel packages, I will conduct an audit of the official Debian repository (and online) for keywords that will bring up numerical packages that use parallelism, beyond the set identified above. I will read their documentation and research the problems involved to find the right functions and data to test for, and I will use the initial data gathered during my benchmarks to establish a baseline for which the regression tests will test against in the future. I will consult references for benchmarking numerical packages to make sure my metrics are meaningful. I will use Plotly to produce graphs for the metrics shown in the web page.",

          "abstract_html": "PROTACs represent a very promising emerging drug modalities. Traditional modalities, small-molecule drugs, for example, or monoclonal antibodies, are limited to certain modes of action, like targeting specific receptors or blocking particular pathways.  Due to its ability to target proteins that have been traditionally difficult to target with conventional methods, PROTACs have attracted substantial interest from both academic researchers and pharmaceutical companies, with several PROTACs currently in clinical trials for various indications, including cancer and neurodegenerative disorders. \n\nHowever, the exploration of PROTACs is still relatively in its infancy. With many open research questions, my proposal implements a tutorial, a common feature in DeepChem, to explore how to computational investigate PROTACs. More specifically, I provide a guide towards exploring available PROTAC datasets, developing featurization capabilities, and a multimodal sequence and structure model to infer protein degradation abilities of PROTACs, a clinically relevant  biopharmaceutical property. My  tutorial will be implemented through a Jupyter notebook which highlights the convenience and low-code capabilities of DeepChem for the scientific community. To demonstrate this, I will implement a few under-the-hood features to process available PROTAC datasets. My tutorial notebook can easily load data and build upon available models in DeepChem to develop a multimodal model for downstream inference. I hope this project provides a strong foundational understanding for researchers and the scientific community to explore computational methods for PROTAC design and optimization, possibly contributing to more effective research and development with downstream clinical benefits.  Overall, I believe this project will contribute to the overall mission of DeepChem by democratizing computational life science research for all.",

They are used in cancer checkpoint blockades, treatments for viral infection, and useful in situations of snakebites as anti-venom. Current methods of antibody discovery involve inoculating various chimeric animal constructs with specific antigens and isolating and purifying antigen-specific molecules. As such there has been a significant interest in designing antibodies in-silico. A growing number of large language models have been employed to capture the sequence distributions of these proteins, with varying degrees of success. However, the vast majority of language models are encoder-only transformers whose target-conditioned sequence generation capabilities are limited, and their code is prototypical rather than production ready. This project aims to integrate and finetune a target-conditioned LLM for eptiope-specific antibody design. Extending DeepChem's codebase to include support for this class of therapeutics would not only help democratize this technology for resource constrained operations, but also bring these groups onto a platform with a lively user base and healthy collaborative environment.",

Current approaches integrated in DeepChem, such as the use of (geometric) deep learning or molecules fingerprints, mainly focus on predicting protein-ligand binding affinity, and require complex data and/or are computationally expensive.\n\nThis project focuses integrating ESM-2 (a state-of-the-art protein language model from Hugging Face) with DeepChem, for the purpose of protein binding site prediction. This integration will enable DeepChem library to utilize powerful protein representations learned by ESM-2. A detailed tutorial will be written to provide not only a workflow for streamlined binding site prediction, but a guide that empowers researchers to use protein language models for further tasks within DeepChem. This project broadens DeepChem's toolbox, making it more versatile for the drug discovery community, and ultimately accelerating progress in this area. \n\nThe main deliverables are:\nA function for feature extraction using the pre-trained ESM-2 model.\nIntegration of extracted features with binding site information.\nDeepChem model architecture for protein binding site prediction.\nReports for model performance and evaluation metrics.\nTutorial documenting the complete workflow, including code, data pre-processing steps, model training details, and visualizations of predicted binding sites (if possible).\n\nIf time allows, an additional tutorial showcasing the application of ESM-2 protein representations for a different task (e.g., generating peptide binders for target proteins), or implementation of a LoRA wrapper for the ESM-2 model, along with a corresponding tutorial explaining its functionality will be developed.

We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC contributors have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (>1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.",

The project proposes developing an open-source Graphical User Interface (GUI) that integrates with various foundational models for image segmentation tasks. A key strength lies in its ability to leverage multiple models, empowering users to tackle diverse image segmentation challenges. I propose completing this project in three phases: First, we will determine the range of image segmentation domains covered by our application. Then, we will select frameworks to design the GUI's frontend and backend sides. Lastly, We will test the GUI for user-friendliness and prepare it for open-source release, along with the complete documentation",

Currently, in order to make partial updates to a JSONField, developers need tol oad model instance to the memory, modify JSONField data as objects, then call save() on the model instance, or write custom mapping for JSON functions as Func subclasses, and use them in update().\n\nIt would be better if Django has built-in support for doing partial JSONField updates more efficiently and more idiomatic to how developers can currently query JSONFields (i.e. with key transforms). In order to achieve that, this proposal intends to create an implementation for all databases supported that developers can use in order to update partial values of JSONField.\n\nThis project aims to accomplish the problem by dividing it into two big parts: first, implement JSONSet and JSONRemove functions to allow partial updates to JSONField. Second, add support for key transforms in update() for JSONField to make it easier to use for developers.\n\nThe project will be executed on creating JSONSet for SQLite, MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle first, then, create JSONRemove on same databases.

This would allow Winery to support the latest version of the OASIS TOSCA standard and handle dynamic type additions.\n\nThe expected outcomes of the project include:\n\n1-Developing an LSP server that supports the latest OASIS TOSCA 2.0 standard.\n\n2-Ensuring that the LSP server is aware of newly introduced types and makes them available in the service template.\n\n3-Enabling the LSP server to handle multiple files.\n\n4-Demonstrating the functionality of the LSP server using compatible IDEs such as Eclipse Theia, Visual Studio Code, or Eclipse IDE.\n\n5-Writing clean and maintainable code, with a preference for using modern Java (version 21 or later).\n\n\nThe proposal indicates that the project's size is estimated at 350 hours and rates its difficulty as medium.\n\nOverall, the proposal aims to improve the security and functionality of Eclipse Winery by implementing an LSP server for OASIS TOSCA YAML files, thereby providing a more robust and comprehensive modeling environment.",

          "abstract_html": "Open source projects often only have a few contributors. They try to incorporate all new ideas and improvements. However, this leaves little time for testing, which means that the quality of the software suffers. Unfortunately, this also applies to Eclipse 4diac.\n\nLast year, the foundation for automated testing 4diac IDE was laid with Eclipse SWTBot.  \nHowever, these tests only cover the most important basic functions such as creating a new project, drag&drop of Function Blocks (FBs) and creating connections between them.\n\nThe extended functions are still tested manually, such as the SubApps, error markers or loading and testing larger test projects. It has also become apparent that the automated tests need to be more stable, as the 4diac IDE is constantly being extended and improved and some tests that ran last year are no longer running due to these changes.\nTherefore, these tests need to be more stable and also easily adaptable. \n\nAn important step in this regard will be that the tests will no longer rely on hard-coded coordinates, but will be able to search for elements by ID. The ability to access the property sheet of 4diac IDE also promises improvements, as it will be important for advanced testing. Nearly every 4diac element has one or more property sheets.",

The current state of its graphical editors presents challenges, as they timely result in poor user experience and frequent errors. To overcome these issues, there is a strong need to introduce an automated test suite specifically for the graphical editors. These test suites will detect errors that will enhance the overall reliability of the editors. Through automated testing, we can effectively implement error indicators within graphical models, ensuring timely identification and resolution of issues. With that, these test suites will provide support to features characterized by deep hierarchical nesting, which directly complicates interaction within the graphical editors. By systematically addressing these challenges, we aim to significantly improve the usability and reliability of the graphical editors within the 4diac IDE.",

Our mission is to create and improve toolchains and runtimes that enhance the functionality and efficiency of eBPF, a revolutionary technology for running sandboxed programs within the Linux kernel without changing kernel source code or loading kernel modules.\n\nOur projects include:\n\n- bpftime: A userspace eBPF runtime. It offers rapid uprobe 10x faster than kernel uprobes, and syscall hook capabilities. It's compatible with kernel eBPF and existing eBPF toolchains, and can be injected into any running process without restart or manual recompilation. It can work with kernel eBPF or the eBPF runtime in other userspace processes.\n- Wasm-bpf: Cooprated with WaseEdge, we build the first user-space development library, toolchain, and runtime for general eBPF programs based on WebAssembly, allows lightweight Wasm sandboxes to deploy and control eBPF applications in k8s clusters.\n- GPTtrace: The first tool generates eBPF programs and traces the Linux kernel through natural language. With our AI agents, it can produce correct eBPF programs on 80%, while a baseline of GPT-4 is 30%.\n- eunomia-bpf: A tool to help developers build, distribute and run eBPF programs easier with JSON and WebAssembly OCI images\n\nOur commitment extends beyond tool development to education. We offer extensive resources for those looking to master eBPF, from beginners to advanced users. To discover more about our projects and educational materials, visit us at eunomia.dev.",

          "abstract_html": "The Pocket Science Lab (PSLab) Android app currently offers a range of scientific instruments for on-the-go data collection and analysis. However, there's a pressing need to enhance the functionality of the oscilloscope feature and introduce support for new instruments, so that it attains equivalence to the dedicated devices. This proposal aims to address these issues by updating the oscilloscope module with advanced features and integrating support for additional instruments. The existing oscilloscope feature in the PSLab Android app lacks certain functionalities crucial for comprehensive data analysis, hindering users' ability to conduct precise experiments or measurements. Furthermore, the absence of support for new instruments limits the versatility of the app. To solve these challenges, a two-fold approach is proposed. Firstly, the oscilloscope will be updated to enhance waveform visualization, integrate automated measurements, and implement advanced triggering options. Secondly, support for new instruments will be implemented by identifying key scientific instruments, developing drivers and interfaces for seamless integration, and enhancing the user interface. Upon project completion, the deliverables will include enhanced oscilloscope functionality integration, smooth operation across all oscilloscope channels, implementation and calibration of designated sensors, integration and operation of other I2C compatible sensors, and comprehensive unit testing for all newly implemented features.",

          "abstract_html": "To address the challenges identified with the FOSSology scheduler, particularly the limitations stemming from its programming language (C) and its linear queue design, proposed idea is to refactor current scheduler codebase in python and integrating Rocketry to create a more flexible, maintainable, and feature-rich scheduler.  \n\n1. Task Scheduling: Implement task scheduling with rocketry, utilizing its cron-style syntax for defining job frequencies. This allows for precise control over when jobs are executed, aligning with FOSSology's existing scheduling requirements.\n\n2. Mutual Exclusivity and Concurrency: Define tasks with mutual exclusivity constraints directly within Rocketry, ensuring that jobs which should not run concurrently are handled appropriately. Utilize Rocketry's support for asynchronous execution to improve the scheduler's efficiency and responsiveness.\n\n3. Error Handling and Logging: Built-in error handling and logging mechanisms to ensure that job failures are captured accurately, and relevant information is logged for debugging purposes.",

All these cases would benefit of specific configuration.\nAs of today handling those configuration manually represents a barrier for communities without technical experts who could understand and optimize the devices ethernet ports configuration appropriately.

          "abstract_html": "Project Description\n\nWhile the Linux network stack evolved throughout the past years with support for new protocols and features, it has become more complex, which introduces overhead and currently hampers its throughput potential.\nThe idea in this proposal is to intercept an incoming data package as soon as possible inside or even before the Linux network stack through the eBPF XDP or TC hook.\nTo implement this, a combination of an eBPF kernel space and a user space program is needed. While the user space will parse OpenWrt Firewall rules and pass them through a BPF map to the eBPF program, the eBPF program will parse incoming packages, apply the rules for matching packages, and redirect or drop the package.\n\n\nBenefits to community networks\n\nThe OpenWrt community could possibly benefit from higher throughput for traffic on their (CPU-limited) embedded devices. Especially since current WiFi chips are going to provide above 1GBit/s wireless throughput, the need for an efficient data plan for rule-based packet processing (forwarding, mangling, and dropping) is needed. Within this project, we address this with the offloading capabilities from eBPF within the Linux network stack.\n\n\nMilestones\n\n * Creation of an eBPF package forwarder\n * Creation of a user space program for loading and communicating with the eBPF program\n * Extend the user space program with a Firewall rule parser\n * Apply the parsed rules on incoming packages in the eBPF program\n * Evaluate the performance of the implementation (XDP and TC)",

Many communities could be used and even today they use it as a very important tool for the collection of funds, for the payment of the provider and sometimes even for people who work. Everybody can manage the system with Pirania UI. each router has access to the Captive Portal system and this makes it be distributed and extremely used in a community and of different types of governance. Pirania has different options of governance, this means that each community can understand the best use that it can make with the system and different cases of use. but for it to be more complete it is important to raise the different ideas that have already been raised by the community. And after the latest versions of lime-packages, pirania is not included, mainly because the basis of pirania’s operation is the iptables rules contained in ./usr/bin/captive-portal. As iptables ends up creating a very large file, the new version of libremesh decided to migrate from iptables to nftables. This and other changes need to be made to fit pirania into a new release.",

      "description_html": "GeomScale is a research and development project that delivers open source code for state-of-the-art algorithms for problems at the intersection of data science, optimization, geometric, and statistical computing. The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration.",

          "abstract_html": "Indexes are baskets of stocks with specific characteristic. They provide examples for diversification in investing to mitigate the volatility of portfolios. Therefore, many investors, including institutions such as fund managers, attempt to build their portfolios to track closely major indexes. However, the effort and the transaction cost for tracking the exact constituents of indexes is not negligible, especially for indexes of many stocks (S&P500). An approach to reduce the transaction cost in index tracking is the sparse replication strategy which tries to mimic the index return through a subset of its constituents. \n\nIn this project, we implement this method through the point of view of mean-variance optimization, i.e., to minimize the tracking error as a quadratic utility function. We first replicate the study in (Shi, Shu, Tian 2020) \"High-dimensional index tracking based on the adaptive elastic net\". This means we will implement an algorithm for sparse index replication using optimization with adaptive elastic net regularization. By implementing a Python framework and exploring possible open-source optimizers, we aim to deliver to GeomScale community a new functionality of portfolio selection, which covers data parsing and preprocessing, backtesting with configurable parameters and automated fine-tuning of hyper-parameters. The next step is to test different ideas to improve this method and calibrate the hyper-parameters to fit the market condition.",

          "abstract_html": "The first genome-scale models of metabolism appeared in 1999 and 2000. In the following years fundamental Microbial Systems concepts were developed such as in silico methods and algorithms to analyze their properties. Genome-scale Metabolic models (GEMs) built on genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions (GENREs) are capable of deciphering the complex interactions occurring in bacteria, through predictions of the possible mechanism underlying these interactions. \ndingo is a Python package that supports a variety of methods to sample from the flux space of metabolic models, based on state-of-the-art random walks and rounding methods. Aim of this project is to enhance dingo by incorporating a  preprocessing class to reduce and simplify metabolic networks, by removing certain reactions and metabolites. To identify correlated reactions, i.e. the flux of one depends on the others,  I will develop a post-processing function to calculate correlation metrics and compare pairwise reaction fluxes. Additionally, another function will create graphs from the  correlation matrix aiming to predict metabolic pathways.\nIn the second half of the project, I will implement approaches  for building microbial communities models. Two main approaches are to be implemented: Bag of Genomes and Bag of Genes. I will develop :  a new class (“dingo.Community()”) that will  read and store a community model of two microbes based on the user’s approach of choice. Its output will be then used as input to the dingo.PolytopeSampler to proceed with sampling steps. \nSampling in the community flux space with the different sampling methods already supported by dingo and benchmarking of the community modeling approaches against real data will be delivered. Refactoring current dingo functions to adjust the new functionality will be done too.",

Leveraged to provide scalability and efficiency for this computationally intensive process, methods such as the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) stand out for their excellent fit for such a task, where the algorithm has to deal with truncated multivariate distributions, as highlighted by Pakman and Paninski. Seamless integration within the VolEsti package is ensured using C++, which aligns with the best practices for developing high-performance mathematical software discussed by Fisikopoulos et al. \n\nThroughout this project's entire research and development process, a blog will be maintained, monitoring all the insights, challenges, optimizations, and developments that will happen.

This will include checks for both the existing \"file\" backend and the new \"retable\" backend. The project will leverage Git's polymorphism in handling refs to ensure that all ref names are conformant and to prevent directory/file conflicts among ref names. Additionally, it will ensure the \"packed-refs\" file is well-formatted and that refs are ordered lexicographically.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeliverables for the project include the infrastructure setup for backend-specific checks, implementation of generic ref checks, and unit tests to ensure correctness.

Once a query is written, it can be effortlessly executed via the HTTP SPARQL endpoint, and the results will be presented in a visually appealing format, enhancing readability and user experience. \nBy lowering the barrier to entry for newcomers, boosting developer productivity with visual editing, and fostering collaboration through easier query sharing, this web IDE promises to significantly improve the experience for those using libtracker-sparql to interact with RDF databases.",

Finally, the plan is to make libvaladoc parse comments in the GI-Docgen format. Upon the completion of this project, the Vala compiler and Vala API generator will be able to use these latest attributes in the generation and parsing of GIR files.

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

They are both satellite-based augmentation systems (SBAS) that enhance the accuracy and reliability of GNSS. One of the main advantage is the improvement of vertical and horizontal accuracy. By developing acquisition and tracking blocks to capture these signals, precise positioning and advanced research on the ionosphere could be enhanced. \n\nAs a user with a year of experience using GNSS-SDR and GNURadio, the process of developing the required solution will be carry out in a better way. The expected time to complete the project is 350h, which can be splitted in these deliverable groups: \n\n1.- 50h: acquiring information about the problem and studying the way acquisition and tracking blocks work in GNSS-SDR. The type of signals, the way to decode messages and their structure, should be well understood before starting coding the solution. The proposed deliverable is a short presentation, in order to show this information to the mentors and after that, proceed with the coding. \n\n2.- 250h: the main block of the project. During this period, the solution has to be created in C++. The different processing blocks (acquisition, tracking, observables and PVT) must work at the end of the period for SBAS signals. The proposed deliverables are tracking and acquisition blocks working after the first 150h, and then the integration with the observables and PVT has to be demonstrated. \n\n3.- To conclude, the last 50h of project are dedicated to develop tests to demonstrate the robustness of the solution and to implement the code for real-time signals.",

This process involves creating, throwing, and finally destroying the exception object. The strategy employed is known as the Zero Cost strategy, which aims to minimise the impact on the main program execution path. It achieves this by pushing all exception handling operations into separate side tables, thus avoiding any potential negative effects on the instruction cache.\nWhen an exception is caught, GCC utilises DWARF information to unwind the stack, allowing the program to resume execution at the appropriate point. However, one current limitation is that GCC does not track the specific type of exception that is thrown.\nThis project aims to improve the nothrow detection in GCC which will allow to eliminate the dead exception handling regions and thus optimise the intermediate code generated.",

It proposes a method to execute offloaded code in a separate CPU process on the same host, simplifying debugging and avoiding the need for a GPU setup. The work involves creating a host-ISA offloaded code generation mode and a libgomp plug-in to interface with the libgomp offloading machinery, managing the new process for the offloaded code. This approach can simplify debugging issues related to memory mapping or multi-device offloading, and potentially simulate GPU-like parallelism using CPU threads for a broader range of debugging scenarios.",

Many closely-related programming models exist such as CUDA and OpenCL. OpenCL is a popular framework for writing massively parallel code given its broader ecosystem and supported platforms. GIMP is a popular free open-source image manipulation tool often shipped as the default tool in many Unix-based distributions. GIMP uses GEGL internally for accelerating various image processing tasks. GEGL comes with OpenCL implementations for many operations. However, the OpenCL backend in GEGL was often slower than the baselines and resulted in incorrect outputs (and crashed sometimes). The goal of this project is to enumerate all the existing OpenCL implementations in GEGL, write a thorough suite of tests for them, and fix as many implementations as possible. If time permits and once correctness is established via tests, the project adds new faster implementations for popular operations. A successful completion of the project would allow the OpenCL backend to be enabled by default and allow the end-users to take advantage of hardware acceleration on their devices automatically.",

      "description_html": "GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

There are a wide range of applications from assessing infrastructure such as bridges and roads, locating buried utilities, mapping glaciers, finding anti-personnel landmines, to detecting tumours in the human body, and exploring the sub-surface of Mars and the Moon.\n\ngprMax is command-line-driven software written in Python with performance-critical parts written in Cython. It does not currently feature a graphical user interface (GUI) which allows it to be very flexible and scriptable software that can run in high-performance computing (HPC) environments, i.e. on supercomputers.\n\ngprMax can be run on either CPU or GPU. The CPU solver has been parallelised using OpenMP which enables it to run on multi-core CPUs.

These stages are designed to identify and alleviate bottlenecks in the system, with particular attention to Streaming Multiprocessors (SMs), Video Memory, and the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA).\n\nBased on the above analysis, the deliverables should contain several parallel branches. Each component will be thoroughly tested to verify its effectiveness and reliability before integrating these optimizations into the main project branch.",

          "abstract_html": "This proposal bridges the gap between audio processing and machine learning by introducing an automatic differentiation (AD) library for the Faust programming language. This library empowers audio engineers to leverage machine learning within their familiar Faust environment.\n\nThe core of the library will be pre-defined building blocks. These include Faust primitives with built-in derivative functions for common math and audio processing tasks. Additionally, there will be helper functions to simplify program construction and various loss functions specifically suited for audio processing. The proposal also explores Faust Neural Net Blocks (FNNBs), which are pre-written code modules representing specific neural network functionalities. These FNNBs will save development time, improve code maintainability, and allow audio engineers to focus on network architecture rather than low-level programming for each layer.\n\nThe project deliverables will showcase the utility of the AD library in various phases. Phase I will deliver a working example of a differentiable filter or envelope in Faust. Phase II will focus on implementing a full-scale machine learning algorithm. This will be achieved through an autodiff file and a weights file. Finally, Phase III and IV will deliver an autoencoder implemented using FNNBs. \n\nBy combining the AD library, FNNBs, and an architecture file specifying the training process, users can design and train complex neural network models for audio processing tasks entirely within Faust. This eliminates the need to switch between Faust and separate machine learning frameworks, while offering the benefits of automatic differentiation for efficient model training.",

The GitHub app will automate the submission of libraries, manage versioning, and generate documentation automatically to enhance accessibility and ease of use.\n\nPackage Manager Application: Creating a package manager application designed to manage dependencies for Faust projects locally. The package manager will enable developers to efficiently integrate and manage dependencies within their projects, ensuring seamless integration of Faust libraries.\n\nFaust-hub Website: It will contain comprehensive information about Faust libraries available in the central repository. Faust-hub will provide a user-friendly interface for browsing, searching, and accessing Faust libraries, enhancing collaboration and community engagement within the Faust ecosystem.",

The plugin’s features will be focused on composability, modular I/O, and integration with Cables.gl’s WebGL backend. This is in addition to foundational development goals such as creating a pleasant UX, robustness, and elegance. \n\nThis plugin would allow users to create DSP programs without boilerplate and have those programs integrate on a signal flow level with Cables.gl WebGL functionality. There are currently no tools that allow for this to my knowledge, this plugin would offer a unique opportunity for creative coding in both the audio and visual realms including simultaneously live-coding audio and visuals on one platform. \n\nThis signal flow level integration would allow for passing arbitrary data to both the WebGL and WebAudio portions of Cables.gl programs, as well as between these different portions. This includes using shader buffers as audio input, enabling GPGPU for massively parallel audio computations, or audio output as sources for visual effects such as vertex displacement, SDF distortion, and other audio-reactive visual effects. This is in addition to simpler modulation schemes such as passing MIDI or OSC to both audio and graphics portions of programs in parallel or doing the same with Javascript sequencing.",

This lack of consistency and overall vision manifests itself in increased complexity, insufficient integration, and inefficient solutions, making the use of your computer more complicated than it should actually be.\n\nInstead, Haiku has a single focus on personal computing and is driven by a unified vision for the whole OS.

This leads to a concise and declarative style of programming, which differs quite a bit from conventional languages. By controlling side effects and working with immutable data, the programmer can avoid whole classes of bugs.\n\nHaskell generally compiles to fast, native code, but it can also be compiled to other targets like JavaScript (through GHCJS) or LLVM.\n\nIn Google Summer of Code, we attempt to improve not only the language, but the whole ecosystem. This includes (aside from the language itself):\n\n- Compilers\n- Commonly used libraries\n- Commonly used applications written in Haskell\n- Profilers, debuggers and other tools\n- Package managers and infrastructure\n\nWe have compiled an ideas list together with long-time Haskell users, compiler contributors and researchers, and as such we believe these are important projects for the industry and academia both.",

I submitted a draft pull request (https://github.com/haskell/haskell-language-server/pull/4131) to hls's github repository, which lists some todo's, but it should be noted that there is more to this proposal than just the pr's, and any suitable information that can be presented with the help of inlay hints will be included in the work. Since the ability to configure inlay hints is already in the todo, even if inlay hints that are too informative are implemented, they will not be a bother to the user: the user has the ability to configure the information that inlay hints will display.\n\nIn the body of the proposal, I detailed the timeline and details for implementing the idea.\n\nI'll continue to build on the progress of this pull request, gradually implementing more inlay hints usages and important configuration capabilities.",

In Phase 2 we have three options to do, but we’ll try to work on all three. So Phase 2, focuses on improvements based in the web UI on user feedback. This UI will allow searching by keywords or test names, with clear results including timestamps and failure messages. Also, it will automatically insert logs from github workflows action.

          "abstract_html": "Traditionally, technology and dance have moved in separate circles, rarely crossing paths. However, the landscape is changing with the rise of AI in the creative world. One exciting development is the use of AI to create dance choreography. This innovation comes from training AI models on videos captured from a dancer's performance, allowing the machine to learn and generate new dance moves, a process well illustrated in the paper Beyond Imitation: Generative and Variational Choreography via Machine Learning.\r\n\r\nBuilding on this very interesting work, our project aims to take things a step further by focusing on duets. We're interested in exploring how AI can choreograph dances that involve complex interactions between the dancers, reflecting a more dynamic and authentic expression of human connection and creativity.\r\n\r\nThe idea is to expand the aforementioned existing work in AI-generated choreography by introducing modern machine learning techniques to create dance sequences for duo performances. Initially using a generative model with LSTM units to learn from motion-captured dance movements, this project proposes a new approach by incorporating self-attention mechanisms and Graph Neural Networks. These technologies are expected to allow a deeper understanding of the relationships within and between dancers' movements over time.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the project will explore the integration of self-attention mechanisms to replace traditional LSTM sequences, enabling the model to more effectively emphasize significant connections across frames of dance movements. Additionally, it seeks to benefit from capturing the spatial relationships between dancers' joints by using GNNs for pre and post-processing.\r\n\r\nThe deliverables of the project  basically consist of the developed dataset and its visualizations, the implemented agents with their respective weights, and a report together with a repository containing the full documentation and code for each step.",

Our objective is to develop a high-accuracy, transformer-based model that can adeptly navigate the complexities of early Spanish texts, providing a reliable tool for digitizing and preserving valuable historical documents.\n\nTo achieve this, we plan to leverage the TrOCR model, renowned for its proficiency with both printed and handwritten texts, thanks to its innovative hybrid architecture that combines Vision Transformers (ViT) with Transformer models. The project will begin with a thorough preprocessing of the documents, converting them from PDFs to high-resolution images suitable for text recognition. Automated segmentation into line segments using PyTesseract will follow, transforming our dataset into a line-wise format ideal for focused model training.\n\nThe deliverables include:\n1. A robust, transformer-based model fine-tuned for recognizing text in seventeenth-century Spanish documents.\n2. A comprehensive, line-wise dataset of processed images and their corresponding texts, prepared specifically for training and evaluating the model.\n3. Detailed documentation and analysis of the model's performance, including improvements in Character Error Rate (CER) and Word Error Rate (WER).\nUpon acceptance, this project promises to significantly advance the field of document digitization and historical research, offering an innovative solution to a longstanding problem and enabling broader access to valuable cultural heritage.",

However, they use machine learning methods that have been overtaken by recent Deep Learning innovations, and therefore limit the studies that can be carried out on musical creativity and sound/movement interaction. The aim of this project is to use these modern Deep Learning methods to generate music driven by motion capture. The framework consists of 3 distinct modules. Firstly, user gestures are detected using landmarks generated by MediaPipe by Google. Secondly, these landmarks are used to recognize the gesture performed by the user, and generate Open Sound Control (OSC) signals. Finally, the OSC signals are converted into music using Max/MSP. In addition, new gestures can be dynamically added to the framework, with just a few examples, and mapped to new sounds.\nDeliverables:\n- Experiment to estimate the appropriate delay between a gesture and the resulting sound/effect.\n- Framework based on LivePose or Pose2Art using only the gestures predifined in MediaPipe, able to interface the chosen camera and the sound-card\n- Model based on MediaPipe holistic model to classifiy dynamic gestures\n- Famework to map gestures to sounds through OSC signals.\n- Few-Shot Learning-based model to dynamically add new gestures",

It uses two special tools called Spatial Hypergraphs and Lineage Hypergraphs to map out and understand these interactions. Spatial Hypergraphs look at how cells are arranged and interact in space, which helps us understand how they communicate and influence each other. Lineage Hypergraphs track the family tree of each cell, showing how cells evolve and form different parts of the worm's body. By combining these tools, the project aims to get a complete picture of the worm's development, from a single cell to a fully formed organism. This work could help us learn more about basic life processes and improve medical and tissue engineering fields. The project is supported by international organizations interested in neuroscience and the use of advanced computer models to study brain and nervous system development.",

This project has been worked on in OREL for the past 2 years, and a variety of models and tools have been created towards it, utilizing reinforcement learning, active inference and attraction-repulsion based approaches to build several agent-based models. Thus, this framework will represent open-source communities as a system composed of interconnected components (agents), mapping the intricacies of community engagement and collaboration as well as focusing on emergent properties and overall system behaviour.  \n     \nThis project is important to the open-source ecosystem because as the demand for open-source software continues to grow, so do the challenges associated with community management, collaboration, and sustainability.

TVB simulator, written in Python, enables the systematic, model-based inference of neurophysiological mechanisms on different brain scales that underlie the generation of macroscopic, commonly used neuroimaging signals (EEG, MEG, fMRI). In the tvb-ecosystem, there is a new repository called tvb-widgets, which consists of UI widgets for Jupyter notebooks. Offering TVB-web interface's functionality as a JupyterLab widget will enhance integration, workflow efficiency, and interactivity making it a valuable addition to the TVB ecosystem for research and educational purposes. The project focuses on enhancing the tvb-widgets repository and developing new widgets. The proposal is for the implementation of more features from the Connectivity cockpit of TVB's web interface as interactive widgets primarily the Space-time Visualizer widget and the Connectivity Matrix Editor widget. This can be achieved by leveraging different libraries like Ipywidgets, PythreeJs, etc. Essential deliverables include classes, functions, tests, etc., for these widgets.",

The Allen Institute provides a powerful API that allows users to programmatically access and retrieve data. First through data cleaning, and then through data crawling to obtain data that is difficult to access in the API. In addition, domain-specific language models will be fine-tuned or trained using Google's Gemini model for subsequent data acquisition.\nParameter Conversion: Develop tools(scripts) or design large language model prompts to automatically convert extracted data into a parameter format understood by the NetPyNE, such as .hoc or .swc format. Identify how to set reasonable default values for missing data.\nModel construction: Use the converted parameters to construct neural network models of relevant brain regions in NetPyNE. This includes defining neuron types, neuron connectivity, and synaptic interactions between neurons.\nRun Simulation: Run a simulation of the model in NetPyNE to simulate the brain's response to a specific input stimulus.\nCompare Results: Compare the simulation results with actual biological experimental data to verify the accuracy of the model.\n\nIntended set of deliverables:\nAutomated Data Collection Tool.\nParameter Conversion Script.\nSimulation Run Framework.\nResult Validation Report.\nDocumentation and User Guide.",

Current Infant Visual Function Measurement Systems built in previous GSOC 22 and GSOC 23 are efficient and robust solutions but are limited by difficulties with infant cooperation and shortcomings in eye-tracking technology. To address this, a comprehensive upgrade is proposed. A user-friendly and visually engaging interface will be built for researchers and clinicians. Additionally, a wider variety of captivating stimuli, both visual and auditory, will be incorporated to keep infants engaged during testing. The core functionality, eye-tracking, will be significantly improved by exploring advanced deep learning techniques. This will enable precise gaze estimation in all directions, including up and down, providing a more complete picture of an infant's visual attention. Furthermore, a novel test will be developed to identify potential vision issues associated with anisometropic amblyopia. Finally, the system will be designed for seamless integration with various external eye-tracking hardware devices, increasing its flexibility and applicability. This project strives to create a user-friendly and robust Infant Visual Function Measurement System, empowering researchers and clinicians with a powerful tool for early detection and intervention, ultimately leading to better visual development for young children.",

          "abstract_html": "With the advent of machine learning, statistical learning and modelling becoming more prevalent in today’s world, we can estimate values for an unknown data given a trained model i.e. finding value of data(D) given parameter (Θ) .Now what about the reverse? What if we want to find optimal parameter value, given a particular set of dataset. Why is this even required? The very simple answer to this can be found in every modelling and computation textbook. We cannot necessarily measure the other parameters. Let us take an example:\n There are several parameters while defining a neuron whose measurement is difficult to make, for example the axial resistance, the capacitance of the soma etc. Thus to achieve this process we make use of 2 tools, the first is the neuron library which is used for designing your neuron model and setting your parameters ,secondly is a statistical measurement tool used for the parameter estimation .This is done by checking for the voltage value generated by the neuron model and what might the parameter values be for that particular value.\nThe reason to utilize Bayesian inference for parameter estimation is due to the specification of the prior data ,which will help us to increase the accuracy of our model which predicts approximate parameter values. Now the user could specify the prior data on the basis of any previous study or research material.\nNeuroptimus is an open source tool created for the same purpose. It is an interactive tool where the user can drop a dataset file. Train it and use it for parameter estimation .\nI have been tasked to utilize the prior ,the noise (for the calculation of likelihood),and the evidence to find the posterior distribution of the parameter I want to estimate. This is the main gist of the project, but there are various hurdles such as what if it is difficult to find the likelihood ,type of noise, computational costs for multiple parameters etc. These are some other things I believe I will be working on.",

          "abstract_html": "The annotation of research data is essential to ensure its findability and reusability. High-quality data annotations require domain expertise, so that annotations are relevant, but also specific technical skills, such as knowing how to handle JSON/XML files. Additionally, people are often reluctant to change their workflows, and the technical affordances in the case of data annotation intensify this challenge. As a result, researchers tend to stick to their “data handling traditions” as soon as data operations become too complex. Unfortunately, this often means that even though projects like Neurobagel are working hard to make life easier for researchers, these tools are not widely adopted. \n\nMy idea for contributing to the Neurobagel project is to combine a user-friendly interface with a Large Language Model (LLM) approach to make the annotation of tabular data even more effortless for researchers. For the end user, the process should be to provide a tabular file and get a first-pass annotation for review without any intermediate steps. From a technical perspective, this should be accomplished by using a Large Language Model (LLM) to categorize columns, such as participant ID or age. To improve the predictions of the LLM, already annotated data will be linked to explicit knowledge from existing ontologies such as SNOMED CT or the Cognitive Atlas and used to provide context for the LLM.",

An intuitive, easy to pick up, node based filter editor, with intuitive, user-friendly controls\nwith a full-fledged editing workflow containing:\n\na) essential features for navigation and canvas operations such as scrolling, zooming, panning, etc., relevant contextual menus, etc.\n\nb) Intuitive node operations such as selections, an easy system to make connections between nodes with clean and well planned user interfaces.\n\nc) Support for all Filters and Filter Primitives, along with widgets aimed at being easy to understand, which allow editing the properties of the Filter Primitives\n\nd) Ability to save and load the state of the editor, when closing and re-opening, or automatically creating a suitable layout for arranging the nodes, in a clean manner.\n\n2. Creating template classes which can be used in future to implement functionalities requiring similar workflows.\n\n3.

      "description_html": "Computational thinking for all with free visual coding apps\nThe Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.",

The data is stored using Neo4j, a graph database known for its flexibility and scalability. \n\nIt is important that the Internet Yellow Pages contain accurate data from all these sources and provide users with the data quickly and efficiently. However, IHR currently computes a new database of this form each week, and this deployment is not automated, which increases the time it takes to make the new data publicly available. Thus, the goal of this project is to design and implement an automated pipeline to deploy a new database to a remote server each week and to upload the database dump to a public repository. The solution must be maintainable and rigorously tested, with unit tests for each IYP dataset. This ensures that users receive reliable data with no downtime and that future developers can easily expand upon the pipeline.\n\nThese goals were accomplished by completing the following four subparts: creating unit tests, creating a pipeline to automatically compute a database dump and push it to IHR’s archive, integrating the tests into this pipeline, and extending the pipeline to also deploy a running instance of the database to a remote server. Caddy is used to hotswap newly computed databases and to provide access to previously generated databases.",

We have also explored optimization of end-to-end models and even navigation based on segmented images and commands (see video and project link). In this project, we would like to combine the previous acquired knowledge with LLMs, using the projects that we previously developed successfully on GSoC. The idea is to integrate an LLM system with an end-to-end autonomous driving driving model so the user can give commands in text mode directly to the vehicle, as you’d do when using a real-life taxi (“please, stop here”, “please, turn to the left in the following intersection”). This idea has been already explored in research projects, and we will be replicating it (see references).\nhttps://github.com/opendilab/LMDrive\nhttps://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.14786.pdf\nhttps://github.com/wayveai/Driving-with-LLMs",

Our motto is \"Build great things at any scale\".\n\nLong description:\n\nJenkins, originally founded in 2006 as \"Hudson\", is one of the leading automation servers. Jenkins' motto is \"Build great things at any scale\". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.\n\nThis year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins. We have many strategic project ideas which are important to potentially hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users.\n\nThe project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.). Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure and Remoting) and special interest groups. These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project.\n\nThe Jenkins project is a part of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).",

However, it encounters difficulties in propagating large-scale changes across its multitude of plugins. These challenges encompass technology migration, API deprecation, dependency updates, and more. Given the extensive number of plugins—over 1900—in Jenkins, updating each one to accommodate these changes proves to be a laborious and manual process, resulting in many plugins falling behind. To address this issue, this project leverages OpenRewrite to develop a versatile tool capable of transforming code.

          "abstract_html": "Jitsi relies on multiple services across diverse containers, necessitating robust observability tools for effective monitoring. The Prometheus Scraping & Grafana Dashboard project for Google Summer of Code (GSoC) aims to integrate Prometheus to collect metrics from each container seamlessly. By leveraging Prometheus exporters within Jitsi's infrastructure, essential metrics such as resource utilization, network traffic, and service availability will be gathered. These metrics will then be visually represented through Grafana dashboards, providing administrators with actionable insights to enhance system performance and facilitate proactive troubleshooting.\n\nThis integration promises to make stronger operational efficiency and reliability within Jitsi's infrastructure, ensuring uninterrupted video conferencing experiences for users. To further enhance monitoring capabilities, triggers will be set up to notify administrators through communication channels in the event of any issues. By empowering administrators with comprehensive monitoring capabilities, the project underscores Jitsi's dedication to delivering high-quality communication solutions. With Prometheus and Grafana at its core, this initiative not only enhances observability but also strengthens Jitsi's ability to maintain and optimize its complex environment, furthering its commitment to providing a seamless communication experience.",

Investigating real-time updates and creating plans for updating files that are already in use are secondary objectives.\r\n\r\nFor application updates, the project will make use of Electron and electron-builder together with TypeScript and React. Using Electron's autoUpdater module to manage downloads and updates, setting up a background service for silent updates, constructing a non-intrusive user notification system, and ensuring flawless application restarts for updates are important tasks. There will be testing and documentation at every stage of the development process.\r\n\r\nThe timeline spans 14 weeks, starting with initial setup and planning, followed by developing the background update service, implementing the automatic installer and notification system, integrating and testing the updates across all supported platforms, and addressing any unforeseen challenges. The final stages will focus on finalizing documentation, polishing the update mechanism for deployment, exploring live updates, and project wrap-up with mentor review and project submission to Joplin and GSOC.",

          "abstract_html": "The JSON Schema test suite is a collection of JSON schemas, instances (data) and expected validation results -- meaning information about what result an implementation of JSON Schema is expected to produce. These \"known correct results\" are used by a huge number of implementations of JSON Schema in order to ensure they behave correctly under the JSON Schema specification. My proposal involves enhancing the functionality of Bowtie, a tool designed for comparing results from running the JSON Schema test suite across various implementations. Currently, Bowtie generates reports indicating test pass or fail rates for each implementation. The objective is to develop a feature that tracks how these results evolve over time due to bug fixes, new test additions, etc. This involves creating a new 'bowtie trend' command to aggregate and analyze results, enabling users to visualize trends in compliance numbers over time. By integrating this feature into the Bowtie website, users will be able to access graphical representations of failed tests over different time periods.\n\nDeliverables and plan:\n\nDevelopment of a new 'bowtie trend' command for aggregating and analyzing compliance results over time.\n\nIntegration of trend analysis into the Bowtie website to generate graphs illustrating changes in test outcomes.",

It contains a monolithic kernel that runs in 32-bit protected mode and supports full preemptive multitasking.\n\nKolibriOS is a fork of MenuetOS, written almost entirely in FASM (assembly language). However, C, Sphinx C--, C++, Free Pascal, Forth, among other high-level languages and compilers, can also be used in user application development (although FASM is preferred).\n\nThe OS features a rich set of applications that include a word processor, image viewer, graphical editor, textual web browser, and over 30 games. Full FAT12/16/32 and EXT2/3/4 support is implemented, as well as read-only support for NTFS, ISO9660 and XFS. Drivers are written for popular sound, network and graphics cards.\n\nKolibriOS is VERY light on system requirements, using as little as 1MB of disk space and 8MB RAM to run. In terms of processing power, Intel®'s original Pentium® (P5 microarchitecture) or compatible CPU is sufficient to fully enjoy KolibriOS. We strive to become the OS of choice for all older computers, and provide their owners full modern OS experience.",

A Gradle plugin: The main purpose of this Gradle plugin is to generate a runnable app showcasing the Story components written by the developer, tailored for their target platform. This plugin will facilitate the automatic generation of user interfaces for testing components.\n\n2. A Runtime Library: The Runtime Library enables developers to define the specifications of the @Composable components they want to test. This will include an annotation system to mark components as Story items, with the ability to specify component properties and target platforms.\n\nIn practice, developers can integrate this tool into their project structure, which will encompass common and platform-specific modules such as commonMain, androidMain, and desktopMain etc... our Gradle tasks will offer a streamlined process to create an app per platform to display all Story components.",

          "abstract_html": "Dynamic Resource Allocation (DRA) is a new feature introduced in Kubernetes version 1.26 and above, providing an Alpha API that allows users to define Kubernetes objects similar to the Persistent Volumes API for generic resources. With DRA, users can separate the declaration of a resource to be consumed from its actual consumption. This move away from the limited \"countable\" API provided by device plugins allows for a more flexible control over which resources are consumed and where they are allocated.\n\nFor handling host devices, KubeVirt relies on the Kubernetes device plugin framework, which is crucial for scheduling, allocating, and attaching desired devices and resources to running pods. One limitation of this framework is the lack of persistence in device allocation when the pod is not running.\n\nThe proposed solution involves implementing the DRA plugin in KubeVirt for PCI passthrough (with Nvme devices as a Proof of Concept). A DRA driver typically consists of two separate but coordinating components: a centralized controller and a node-local kubelet plugin. The kube-scheduler communicates with the centralized controller, which makes allocation decisions based on the overall cluster state and resource availability. The kubelet-plugins are responsible for discovering and advertising the node's available resources to the kubelet.\n\nAdditionally, the proposed approach suggests enhancing the VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) resource to include resourceClaims under hostDevices. This way, users can create a VMI resource that references a ResourceClaim (Template) which in turn references a registered ResourceClass. KubeVirt components need to be modified to translate the resource claims in the VMI host devices into the PodSpec of the underlying Pod. Finally, the device driver would be deployed along with virt-handler as part of a DaemonSet.\n\nIn summary, this approach aims to leverage the DRA capabilities to enhance host devices allocation",

      "description_html": "LabLua is a research lab at the Catholic University of Rio de Janeiro (PUC-Rio), affiliated with its Computer Science Department. It is dedicated to research on programming languages, with emphasis on the Lua language and reactive programming. It was founded on May 2004 by Prof. Roberto Ierusalimschy, the chief architect of the Lua language.\n\n\nLabLua consists of people from a wide range of backgrounds, including PhD candidates, professors and alumni who are the developers and maintainers of projects that are used by the Lua community at large.\n\n\nWhat is Lua?\n\n\nLua is a powerful, efficient, lightweight, embeddable scripting language. It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.\n\n\nLua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.\n\nWhat is Lunatik?\n\nLunatik is an extension framework for Linux that combines the approaches of Extensible Operating Systems and Scripting Languages. This approach, named Kernel Scripting, advocates that OS kernels can be dynamically extended by using a high-level scripting language. Lunatik is a programming and execution environment that offers two main features: it allows developers to make subsystems scriptable and allows users to run Lua scripts in the kernel.\n\nWhat is Pallene?\n\nPallene is a statically-typed programming language, intended to serve as a more performant companion to Lua. It is designed to seamlessly interoperate with Lua, with first-class support for Lua data types. Pallene is able to be faster than Lua (sometimes as fast as LuaJIT) by taking advantage of the type annotations in Pallene in order to guide the compiler into outputting efficient executable code.",

Isso porque, ambas atuam como ferramentas que facilitam o engajamento dos cidadãos nos processos de tomada de decisão, tornando-os mais acessíveis para todos e, assim, estabelecendo espaços onde as pessoas possam acessar informações e participar de discussões pertinentes à sociedade em geral. A partir disso, essa proposta de projeto visa a criação de uma\nbiblioteca Ruby reutilizável para integração da EJ com o Decidim, com o objetivo de facilitar o estudo das opiniões e do comportamento da sociedade através de dados estatísticos. Para isso, serão utilizadas técnicas de Aprendizado de Máquina (Machine Learning) para analisar as preferências dos usuários, identificando padrões de engajamento e desenvolvendo estratégias personalizadas para envolvê-los mais ativamente nos processos democráticos.",

By integrating EJ with Decidim, a powerful platform for citizen participation, we aim to enhance the capabilities of both tools and enable more inclusive and impactful decision-making processes. This integration will leverage EJ`s artificial intelligence techniques for grouping participants based on their opinions, streamlining decision-making, and facilitating efficient collaboration. Furthermore, it will expand the reach of both platforms, bringing EJ's participation features to Decidim's user base and vice versa, thereby fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing among different communities.

This paper addresses the need for effective space traffic management in an environment where a small number of dominant space situational awareness (SSA) companies overshadow a long tail of competitors, resulting in underutilization of expert insights and missed opportunities for valuable information confrontation. Originating as an initiative under the European Space Agency Tech Innovation, the proposed approach employs business incentives to enhance transparency, predictability, and accountability in line with current and evolving regulations. Leveraging user voting mechanisms, the rules governing applications can evolve dynamically, making it particularly suitable for space traffic management, an arena lacking established global regulations and in urgent need of a coordinated international agreement. Recognizing the orbit as a global commons, effective international negotiation in this context often assumes a business-oriented language. Within the DAO framework, applications serve as global marketplaces for insights, facilitating information exchange for space traffic management, while concurrently functioning as a global market for judgment, where the reliability of participants is evaluated based on their performance.",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

Histograms are essential for data analysis, scientific research, and machine learning, providing valuable insights into data distribution. Currently, LibreOffice users rely on some clunky workarounds to create histograms, limiting productivity and compatibility with industry standards.\n\nThe goal is to implement native histogram chart support in LibreOffice, eliminating the need for workarounds and enhancing the user experience. By leveraging the existing column chart implementation as a starting point, the project will gradually transform and extend the code-base to support histogram-specific functionality. This approach minimizes disruption to the stable code-base while introducing new capabilities.",

Export bugs can be extremely frustrating for users since they can result in the whole application crashing or pieces of a document disappearing due to a document being exported incorrectly.

      "description_html": "Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face! \nThis year also we’ll allow the use of Cloud-based services, like Google’s models Gemini and Palm2.",

Furthermore, discovering the most touristic places in a foreign city or country, along with the best dining spots, shopping locales, and natural vistas, can be a daunting task. \n\nThe main purpose of this application is to simplify the travel planning experience and inspire users to embark on memorable journeys and discover the most captivating point of interests (POIs) tailored to their preferences. The POIs would be generated by running GEMMA, one of the latest open-source generative text AI models, locally on the AI server in Lleida Lab utilizing Docker technology. Utilizing the liquid galaxy technology, the user would be able to visualize their entire trip on the LG rig with 3 or more screens where the tours along with their info would be sent through KML (keyhole markup language) that will help build beautiful and unique visualizations on the LG rig. In case of unavailability of an LG rig, the user would still have a captivating experience through the app and the integrated google maps. \n\nDeliverables - The model trained on the cloud and ready to be inferred in Lleida Lab AI local server. - The new App published on the Play Store under the Liquid Galaxy LAB account. - Full documentation and code on Liquid galaxy lab GitHub.",

Often when we look into places to visit, we come across a range of options, which may result in making incorrect decisions and overspending. This situation can be disheartening for travelers like me. That's why there should be a method that enables us to explore travel spots, with just one prompt. Such a system would enhance the experience of planning a trip making it more delightful and fulfilling.\n\nResolving this I came up with a tool (A Flutter App) that helps users plan travel adventures. By using one of the fastest Generative text AI models, Groq, it builds exciting tales of travelers exploring specific Points of Interest (POIs) selected by the user. The app creates a storyline around sub-POIs. Using the LG Rig the app presents the story in paragraphs each focusing on a sub-POI for a visually immersive experience. It also suggests tour recommendations on the screen to keep users engaged. And the Use cases of this tool is not just limited to travelers but also in education.

The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.\n\nLLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.",

While LLVM/Clang supports various GPU programming interfaces, LLVM IR hinders effective analysis for GPU code with its SIMT model. Clang's mid-level IR (ClangIR) based on MLIR is better suited to capture this information from source code.\n\nThis project proposes adding basic OpenCL C support to ClangIR.\n\nChallenges and Solutions:\n\n1. Code Generation Paradigm Shift: CodeGen and Lowering (ClangIR's compilation passes) employ distinct coding paradigms due to their underlying infrastructure (AST reflection vs. MLIR Pass Rewriter). Migrating existing CodeGen code to the Lowering framework could be complex.\nWe will actively debate the trade-off between optimization potential and implementation complexity to propose and execute well-designed, achievable plans.\n\n2. Scattered OpenCL Support Code: Current OpenCL support code is dispersed throughout the codebase, hindering development quality control.\nStrategies will be developed to address this issue, such as extracting key information from flags like getLangOpts().OpenCL and getOpenCLRuntime(), or implementing systematic code searches to consolidate functionalities and address issues in a structured manner.\n\nThe final deliverables of this project include\n\na) A set of testcases that combines unit tests with integration tests\nb) An AST Consumer for OpenCL C (extension of CIRGen)\nc) A set of MLIR Passes for properly generating SPIR Kernels\nd) A functional and performance test report (optional)\ne) Detailed development documentation for all the above parts",

Identification of those outlying files will lead to an analysis of features in or related to the IR using available tools for analyzing LLVM code. Available flags for the compiler of a given language, say Clang, can be used to identify statistics, such as pass times, related to the compilation pipeline. Pinpointing what features are specific to code compilation, such as certain passes, and how IR features relate to the compilation pipeline will inform compiler implementers and LLVM developers as to what specifically causes an unexpected compilation time. Implementers can then modify the compilers accordingly, and developers can write code in conformance with specific programming structures, in order to minimize compilation times.",

Like last year, this includes continuing to implement missing codegen bits, CIR operations & types, as well as testing. One notable difference is that this time around, there will be a greater focus on lowering CIR to be ABI-compatible with X86.

The objective is to develop a function for encoding classical data onto quantum feature spaces, enabling their representation in a format compatible with quantum processing. By contrasting positive (similar) and negative (dissimilar) pairs in the feature space, contrastive learning facilitates representation learning. The trained embeddings will be assessed against standard encoding approaches using quantum machine learning (QML) models, providing insights into their performance. Through this exploration, the aim is to evaluate the efficacy of quantum embeddings for classical data and compare them with traditional encoding techniques. By harnessing the capabilities of quantum computing and contrastive learning, this endeavor contributes to advancing classical data encoding on quantum platforms, potentially unlocking novel applications in quantum-enhanced machine learning.",

          "abstract_html": "The quest for new physics has encompassed and intrigued physicists for decades. At CERN LHC, high-energy\r\nproton-proton collisions can create new, unstable particles, which then further decay to produce\r\nsprays of outgoing particles. These ”collision events” act as a bases to identify events involving\r\nnovel, uncharted physical processes (Higgs Boson, 2012).\r\nThe topology of these events is governed by the underlying particle production mechanism. A momentum conserving spray of particles - called Jets, is an event topology governed by Quantum Chormodynamics (QCD).\r\nA collision event contains multiple such jets, a core task of data analytics at CERN\r\nexperiments revolves around the task of jet-tagging. The Machine Learning Revolution, propelled by dedicated and streamlined Neural Computation has revolutionized this field of tying particle jets to their originator particle.\r\n\r\nOver time the analytical, QCD-driven approaches for tagging have been replaced by deep-learning based approaches. Using different input representations of particle jets - particularly images, sequences, trees, sets and graphs, most notably deep neural networks (DNNs) - CNNs, RNNs etc. have been used to build new jet-tagging algorithms automatically from simulated samples (from Pythia and\r\nDelphes) and even real data.\r\nThrough this GSoC cohort, I propose a novel scheme to achieve the task of jet-tagging by exploiting\r\nthe most naturally sound, robust representation scheme - that of unordered structures of constituent particles of a jet, and methods to act upon them - namely through Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) that utilize attention-based/hypergraph methods to account for long-distance correlations.\r\nAfter viewing a jet as a Particle Cloud, we utilize a plethora of novel schemes and also a customized Neural Architecture to achieve learning over the dataset of Particle Jets.\r\nWe also work robustly at the inference level, extracting meaningful measures of optimality and correctness of the used approach.",

Despite the groundbreaking nature of their research, the absence of released source code has left a significant gap in practical application and reproducibility. Furthermore, attempts by last year's contributors, Marçal Comajoan Cara and Eyup B. Unlu, to implement the Quantum Orthogonal Transformer faced challenges; Marçal encountered training issues due to NaN values, and Eyup's implementation did not proceed to the training phase of transformers, highlighting the difficulties in realizing these models. This project aims to address these gaps by developing QViT models within the TensorFlow Quantum framework, leveraging this technology to bridge theoretical insights with practical application, thereby marking a potential first in applying these models for the analysis of particle jet images in HEP.",

This data will be converted into a Graph Data using 3 approaches where each station, each variable , and patches of the matrix are taken as the nodes of the Graph. Edges are formed using KNN or by forming edges between adjacent stations.

This approach, essential due to the vast amount of data, evolved from manual labeling to using unsupervised methods, like variational autoencoders, for unbiased dark matter analysis. Recently, self-supervised learning, an innovative technique that generates its own supervisory signals, has shown promise. Stein et al. applied this method using a convolutional neural network (CNN) on simulated strong gravitational lens images, outperforming traditional supervised methods. This was supported by research I contributed to in the DeepLense project during Google Summer of Code (GSoC) 2023. However, the application to real images remains underexplored. My GSoC project proposal aims to bridge this gap by applying advanced Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to real-world datasets and comparing these findings with those from simulated datasets.

Currently, there has been an increasing trend in pre-training the vision transformers on auxiliary task and then fine-tuning it for downstream tasks. This resulted in score increment of downstream tasks along with some emergent properties. With the benefits of pre-training, we would like to see how this converts to CMS data. Earlier the data has been shared either through parquet/hdf5 file format. Using ViT-MAE for compression of data would reduce the challenges associated with working with larger datasets. Earlier methods have used swin transformers of different window sizes without any pre-training and achieved substantial score. However, this project employs self-supervised pre-training for a better score in downstream tasks.",

Equivariant networks are uniquely suited for this task due to their inherent ability to handle the rotational and reflectional symmetries common in astronomical images, thus maintaining predictive accuracy regardless of orientation changes in spatial data.\r\n\r\nThe project will unfold over 175 hours, meticulously planned across several phases to ensure a thorough approach from conceptualization to deployment. Starting with a comprehensive review of current equivariant neural network architectures and their potential application in analyzing astronomical data, the project will proceed to curate a dataset from existing astronomical surveys. This dataset will include systems with known numbers of planets to serve as a foundation for model training and validation.\r\n\r\nBy developing a model that can accurately regress on the number of planets in a system, this project seeks to create a robust tool capable of adapting to the complexities inherent in observational data, such as direct images, transit data, and radial velocity measurements. The ultimate goal is to provide astronomers with a novel method for analyzing the spatial configurations of planetary systems, thereby enriching our understanding of the universe's myriad worlds.\r\n\r\nExpected outcomes include a highly accurate equivariant computer vision model, comprehensive performance evaluation, and extensive documentation to support further research and potential real-world applications in exoplanet discovery and characterization.

By exploiting the randomness of quantum systems, the project seeks to enhance the efficiency and accuracy of Monte Carlo simulations.

The classical DM algorithm consists of two main parts: a forward diffusion process and a learned denoising step.

The latter is the biggest bottleneck in model training and is likely to benefit from the implementation of parametric quantum circuits (PQCs), creating a hybrid quantum DM. This model would be trained on multiple high energy physics (HEP) datasets, such as the Quark-Gluon dataset for generating quark and gluon jets, alongside a classical DM, and the results could be evaluated taking into account resources, time, and quality.",

In recent years, machine learning techniques, particularly supervised learning, are being utilized for substructure detection, and other regression and classification tasks on the lensing dataset. With strong gravitational lensing, the available labeled training data is scarce, and moreover some classes have fewer samples than others. But, supervised learning require abundant labeled training data and can be biased by class imbalances in the training dataset. To circumvent this, previous works have utilized simulated lensing dataset for supervised learning. However, this approach may result in diminished performance on running inferences with real datasets. In computer vision, self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a potent solution, particularly effective in scenarios with abundant unlabeled data and scarce labeled data.

This proposal aims to leverage state-of-the-art Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) techniques to develop robust models that outperform existing supervised baselines. By exploiting unlabelled data, these SSL approaches can allow models to learn rich representations enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of particle reconstruction and identification tasks at fine-tuning stage with labelled data.\n\nI-JEPA (Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture) is a new approach, which aims to improve the semantic level of self-supervised representations without relying on extra prior knowledge encoded through image trans- formations. Given a context block, I-JEPA is trained predicting missing information in an abstract representation space. The targets are representation blocks obtained by dividing the input into non-overlapping patches and encoding them with a target-encoder. A subset of these representations is randomly sampled for loss computation. The context block, on the other hand, is derived from a single block randomly sampled from the input and processed through a context encoder. Overlapping regions between context and target blocks are removed to maintain a non-trivial prediction task. This approach represents a novel direction in self-supervised learning, addressing limitations of previous methods in producing high-level semantic representations suitable for various downstream tasks. I-JEPA has shown to be computationally efficient and outstanding results in image classification by linear probing its learnt representations.\n\nDeliverables:\n-Implemented SSL training pipeline.\n-SSL pre-trained model.\n-Fine tuned models on specific tasks.\n-Preprocessed datasets ready for training and evaluation.\n-Documentation covering implementation details, and experimental results",

          "abstract_html": "As MariaDB continues to evolve and improve, MySQL users may consider it as a better alternative. The absence of some spatial functions could be a drawback for some of them and potentially make the migration process difficult.\nMy goal is to implement the following spatial functions: ST_IsValid, ST_Validate, - MBRCoveredBy, ST_Collect, ST_GeoHash, ST_Simplify, ST_LatFromGeoHash,  ST_LatFromGeoHash and ST_PointFromGeoHash.\n\nFor each new function to implement, I will start by importing the corresponding tests from the MySQL test suite. These tests serve as an optimal starting point. Given that the primary goal is to ensure compatibility between MySQL and MariaDB, passing the same set of tests on both codebases ensures uniform behaviour. Additionally, these tests serve as a valuable supplement to the documentation, offering detailed insights into the expected behaviour of each function while also documenting edge cases. Moreover, as new tests are written when fixing a bug, we can mitigate the risk of encountering previously resolved issues by the MySQL developers.\n\nThe spatial functions already implemented, are defined in the sql/item_geofunc.h file. The new functions will also be placed in the same file and will be implemented by extending the interfaces that are already defined. For instance, ST_IsValid will extend Item_bool_func_args_geometry which is the class that defines the interface for all the MariaDB native functions returning boolean measurements of a single GEOMETRY argument.\n\nIn MySQL, the functions ST_GeoHash(longitude, latitude, max_length) and\nST_GeoHash(point, max_length) do not return a special datatype but a string. I want to make a more in-depth analysis regarding this function and evaluate if defining a\ncustom datatype would be a viable option and if it would grant meaningful performance improvements.",

It has been developed at the Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali (formerly Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale) of the University \"Politecnico di Milano\", Italy. MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary simulation of multibody, multiphysics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible bodies (geometrically exact & composite-ready beam and shell finite elements, component mode synthesis elements, lumped elements) subjected to kinematic constraints, along with smart materials, electric networks, active control, hydraulic networks, and essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft aerodynamics. MBDyn simulates the behavior of heterogeneous mechanical, aeroservoelastic systems based on first principles equations. MBDyn can be easily coupled to external solvers for co-simulation of multiphysics problems, e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), terradynamics, block-diagram solvers like Scicos, Scicoslab and Simulink, using a simple C, C++ or Python peer-side API. MBDyn is being actively developed and used in the aerospace (aircraft, helicopters, tiltrotors, spacecraft), wind energy (wind turbines), automotive (cars, trucks) and mechatronic fields (industrial robots, parallel robots, micro aerial vehicles (MAV)) for analysis and simulation of complex systems dynamics. The extension of available analysis domains to new models and the introduction of new analysis domains is planned, and problem-driven: if you need to solve a specific problem, let us know. Run-time loading of user-defined modules is leveraged to let users extend the feature library (elements, drives, constitutive laws, and more). On GNU/Linux, real-time execution is supported under RTAI, the Real-Time Application Interface, and POSIX tight scheduling.",

The project entails incremental development, starting with familiarization and planning, extending the entity library, managing model behavior, creating a model container, integrating with Blendyn, and finally, incorporating methods for aeroelastic models.

      "description_html": "MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Welcoming documentation such as the User Guide https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/ make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than almost two thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",

Achieving this goal will improve the accessibility and reusability of data generated by simulations by allowing analysis of trajectories on computers with only modest disk and memory sizes. \n\nEarly prototypes of the Zarrtraj reader and writer show promise as performant and flexible solutions to the MDAnalysis streaming goal. However, after receiving community feedback, we've realized that adding streaming capabilities for an existing format will lead to more sustainable code and make it easier to drive tool adoption.\n\nThe goal of this project is to make the existing H5MD trajectory format cloud-streamable into MDAnalysis by using Kerchunk to reformat HDF5 metadata and Zarr to handle IO with different storage backends.\n\nWith this overarching goal in mind, major milestones will include: \n\n1. Building a trajectory reader that can read from AWS S3, Google Cloud Buckets, and Azure Blob storage and data lakes.\n\n2. Benchmarking streaming performance in iteration and basic analysis as compared to locally-stored H5MD trajectories.\n\n3. Achieving an overall repository test coverage of >80%.\n\n4. Documenting the process of uploading and streaming an H5MD trajectory for users.\n\n5. Building and distributing the package via Conda Forge.",

          "abstract_html": "Direct interoperability between molecular dynamics software is critical for enabling collaboration, data transfer and easy use by scientists. OpenBabel is a popular toolbox for chemical molecular modelling as it enables searching, conversions, analysis and data storage. The ability to interconvert chemical file formats with OpenBabel, in particular, opens up the ability to utilise and work with other packages, as OpenBabel enables input and writing of over 100 chemical data file formats. Therefore, expanding to OpenBabel will hugely increase the ability of MDAnalysis to handle a variety of data formats and encourage greater adoption of MDAnalysis as an “all-in-one” package for molecular dynamics analysis.\n\n\nThe converters already established in the MDAnalysis package for OpenMM, ParmED and RDKit either read coordinate files into their respective objects before using them to create a MDAnalysis Universe or convert Universes in the reverse direction. I plan to take a similar approach to these existing converters. I will utilise OpenBabel Python bindings to make my task of introducing interoperability much easier, since Python code in the MDAnalysis package can easily access OpenBabel attributes (as long as the user has installed OpenBabel in an appropriate directory). I will start with conversion of MDAnalysis AtomGroup objects to OpenBabel OBMol objects, then work on conversion in the reverse direction. This means access to alternative formats and file type export options will be prioritised. Then, I will create a second converter file to convert OpenBabel OBMols to MDAnalysis Topologies, or adds them  to a pre-existing Topology.",

      "description_html": "When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.\n\nIt addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.\n\nFinally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.",

Implement a central YAML workflow file within the core repository to manage version checks, job dispatching, and error reporting. This workflow will be responsible for triggering platform-specific builds and tests using matrix.os.\n\n3. Configure robust error reporting mechanisms within the workflows to ensure timely alerts and facilitate issue identification.

          "abstract_html": "This proposal seeks to enrich the mlpack library by incorporating advanced evolutionary strategies, specifically focusing on enhancing the Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES) through the integration of Increasing POPulation size CMA-ES (IPOP-CMA-ES) and Self-Adaptive Surrogate-Assisted CMA-ES (saACM-ES). The core of this initiative is to tackle complex optimization problems more effectively by leveraging these sophisticated variants.\r\n\r\nCMA-ES is celebrated for its adaptability and effectiveness in dealing with real-world optimization challenges by dynamically adjusting the search distribution. To augment this capability, the IPOP-CMA-ES variant introduces a restart mechanism with an increasing population size, aimed at improving the algorithm's ability to escape local optima and discover the global optimum in multimodal functions. Further enhancing the CMA-ES framework, the saACM-ES variant employs a surrogate model to approximate the objective function's landscape, significantly reducing the computational expense of function evaluations.\r\n\r\nThe project is structured around three pivotal deliverables to ensure a clear, measurable progression. Initially, by week 6, the IPOP mechanism will be fully integrated, accompanied by comprehensive tests and documentation. Following this, the saACM-ES strategy will be implemented by week 10, ensuring its reliability and efficiency through extensive testing and well-detailed documentation. The final stage, culminating in week 12, involves refining the implementations, enhancing documentation, and showcasing the new capabilities through examples. This comprehensive approach aims not only to bolster mlpack’s suite of algorithms but also to pave the way for future innovations within the library.",

It supports unlimited staves, linked parts and part extraction, tablature, MIDI input and output, percussion notation, cross-staff beaming, automatic transposition, lyrics (multiple verses), fretboard diagrams, and in general everything commonly used in sheet music.\n\nStyle options to change the appearance and layout are available and style sheets can be saved and applied to other scores. In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.\n\nMuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.\n\nThe team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.\n\nAll members provide bug tracking support and feedback.",

This feature will provide a list of standard accessibility profiles, such as normal, large, etc., each one customised to specific needs of users with low vision. These profiles will collectively update a set of appearance settings, including staff size, page size, and other relevant ones, to enhance accessibility for users with visual impairments.",

The Dynamics Popup will enable users to seamlessly replace dynamic markings, add new ones, and select hairpin options such as crescendo or decrescendo. Upon selecting a hairpin, the hairpin along with a suggested arrival dynamic will be drawn on the score.

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), WikiPathways (https://wikipathways.org/), SBML (https://sbml.org/), and SBGN (https://sbgn.github.io/). This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing! For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over 18,000 times per month by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our 95% success rate (https://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don’t take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).",

The overarching goal of this project is to enhance the MaREA4Galaxy environment by integrating various omics data types, such as gene expression, proteomics, and metabolomics, enabling researchers worldwide to conduct constraint-based enrichment analyses of metabolic pathways.\n\nThe key enhancements include two primary features:\n\n1. Flux Sampling Interface: This feature provides users with the capability to sample fluxes through cobra models utilizing methods like CHRR (Coordinate Hit and Run with Rounding) and CBS (Corner Based Sampling).\n\n2. Feature Loading Interface: Users can load diverse features for a given set of samples, including RNA-seq data, RAS data, sampled fluxes, metabolomics, and proteomics, initiating a clustering analysis. Subsequently, leveraging the MaREA tool, enriched metabolic maps are generated. Additionally, users gain the ability to compare different clusters derived from the input datasets.",

Key steps include data preprocessing, embedding generation with scGPT, and GRN inference using GENIE3. Evaluation metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the precision-recall curve (AUPR) will be employed, comparing inferred networks against simulated ground truth or expert-curated GRNs from BEELINE.\n\nThe modular design of the pipeline allows for future integration of additional foundation models, enhancing its versatility and extendibility. This research will deepen our understanding of foundation models, particularly scGPT, in GRN inference, guiding the development of improved algorithms and methodologies for deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms from scRNA-seq data. \n\nUltimately, this work will advance biological knowledge by shedding light on gene regulatory processes and their implications across various biological contexts.",

          "abstract_html": "In evanix we explored making the scheduling of Nix builds more controllable. in particular, we look into implementing constraints such as –max-builds and –max-build-time, which ensure that build operations remain within manageable limits while maximizing throughput.\n\nHere the scheduling problem is framed as a mixed integer linear programming(MILP) problem. The input is a graph G=(V,E), where each vertex v represents a Nix package with a cost w(v) and a value p(v). packages that are classified as transitive dependencies—those required solely for other packages carry a value of 0. In contrast, packages that are requested for direct building are assigned a value of 1. This value structure reflects the prioritization of building requested packages over their dependencies.\n\nOur approach aims to identify a set of vertices or packages following the precedence constraints that maximizes the value or the number of packages built with value 1. It is crucial that a vertex or package can only be selected if all of its dependencies are also selected. An edge in the graph represents a dependency, with the indegree of a vertex denoting the number of packages that depend on it and the outdegree representing the number of dependencies of the package.\n\nWe also developed a linear regression model to predict build times based on input derivations, enabling us to incorporate this information into our solver when it’s unavailable in Hydra. This predictive modeling greatly enhances our ability to estimate build durations for packages not built by Hydra, particularly those outside of Nixpkgs. By integrating these predictive insights with our MILP-based scheduling strategy, we aim to create a more robust nix build scheduler.",

The current Python release of ArviZ involves three major modules that also encapsulate its core functionalities- data, plots, and stats.

Development work involving the creation of these is being undertaken, with some key refactoring changes especially planned for the arviz-plots based plotting functionality, which is what this project is based on. \n\n\nThe current plots that Arviz supports were added incrementally to the package over time, including in past GSoC projects, resulting in some redundancy and complicated to extend code. Plans and brainstorming for refactoring this have been around for a while. \n\n\nWork done so far on ArviZ-Plots has included a new class, PlotCollection, an improved backend interface and backend system, and 4 “batteries-included” plots at least partially adapted for this new backend. \n\nFor my role in the course of this project, I will be using the PlotCollection class to implement some other plots from old ArviZ and add modular backend functions and visual elements (an intermediate layer for atomic visual elements used across plot types) required for these as appropriate. I will also be working on creating documentation and tests for these new plots added to ArviZ-plots as well as the PlotCollection class used to do these. For users, the refactored changes aim to provide improved visual aesthetics, an abstraction of aesthetics mapping to subplots and a more compact, flexible API overall.

However, detecting bird nests in this vast and complex landscape is challenging, especially using UAV imagery that varies in quality and detail. Existing image recognition models lack the specificity needed for accurate nest detection in this unique environment, struggling with small or camouflaged objects. This project addresses this gap by developing a robust, machine learning-based model tailored to consistently and accurately identify bird nests in Everglades UAV imagery, even under challenging conditions.",

Variation in the solar spectral distribution changes the useful fraction of irradiance incident on a PV device, and thus can increase or decrease its performance. The relationship between the performance of a PV module and the solar spectrum is captured by a “spectral correction function” (SCF), a plethora of which have been published in the literature over the last quarter of a century. However, only a fraction of these published models are available in pvlib. The aim of this project is to implement new SCFs in pvlib and develop examples to guide users in applying these models. The implementation of these new models will strengthen pvlib through enhancing its flexibility, accuracy, and reliability for different modelling scenarios. Furthermore, the additions to the example gallery will increase the accessibility and usability of these models and pvlib as a whole, in particular for new users.",

It is designed to simplify the setup process of the development environment for researchers and scientists interested in utilizing PyBaMM for battery modeling who may lack familiarity with managing Python environments or repositories.\nThe project intends to enhance the accessibility and usability of PyBaMM for newbies and experienced users alike. Providing a standardized template with best practices and automation tools would lower the barrier to entry for adopting PyBaMM in battery modeling projects. This would in turn make battery modeling more accessible, efficient, and collaborative for the research community. The project also intends to implement \"Model entry points'', allowing community contributors to create and share models of their repositories using the cookiecutter template without directly adding them upstream. This would not only let community contributors retain ownership and choose license terms but also grant flexibility to the PyBaMM team in supporting models, Including all of GitHub's functionality and infrastructure contained within the template.",

Optimal order meaning linear complexity in the number of DOFs, which is the same for the assembly of the associated linear system of equations, making this a completely astonishing and non-trivial result of the theory of multigrid methods.\n    \nBut also in applications this outperforms classical, algebraic based, solver routines when it comes to large scale simulations. Although, the flexibility of modern AMG implementations to not require any such structure of meshes, multirgrid methods remain of great interest not only in academia. So an implementation in the dolfinx framework should allow for versatile extensions and applications.\n\nTo achieve this, multiple components of data structure associated with mesh, geoemtry and topology require close analysis and a fundamentally new feature, the necessary prolongation and restriction operators, need to be implemented. This process is split into multiple isolated, but chronologically dependent phases.",

Users can perform essential tasks like intersection, union, subtraction and merging of genomic intervals and resolving overlaps, crucial for downstream analyses. BioFrame empowers researchers to streamline their genomic data processing tasks. With its open-source nature, BioFrame encourages collaboration and community-driven development, fostering innovation in genomic data analysis.\nThe project aims to develop comprehensive tutorials using Jupyter notebooks to demonstrate the usage of the BioFrame Python library, focusing on real-world user cases using publicly available genomic data from in vitro experiments. Each tutorial will cover a diverse range of genomic analysis scenarios, including but not limited to ChIP-seq analysis, identification of regulatory elements, and structural variation exploration. By utilizing publicly available in vitro genomic datasets, users will have access to high-quality data for hands-on learning and they will gain practical insights into leveraging BioFrame for efficient manipulation and analysis of genomic intervals. The tutorials will provide step-by-step guidance, from data loading to advanced interval-based operations, ensuring users of all skill levels can easily follow along and they will showcase the integration of BioFrame with other Python libraries commonly used in bioinformatics workflows, enhancing users' understanding of its interoperability. These tutorials will be published on GitHub pages, ensuring easy access and facilitating community collaboration and feedback on the tutorial content.

Furthermore, the project will explore using the Rust-based polars package as a potential replacement for pandas in bioframe, with the goal of improving memory efficiency and runtime performance for dataframe operations. Bioframe's core modules will be rebuilt using polars, and benchmarking will be conducted to evaluate performance gains. If successful, the polars implementation will be extended to the entire bioframe package and related functions in other Open2C tools that currently utilize pandas and bioframe methods.",

I will use Python to develop a dedicated module and add it to the Open Source Quartz Solar Forecast library. This integration will involve retrieving live data from Enphase Inverters via the Enphase API and incorporating it into the forecasting algorithm. Upon completion, users will be able to leverage live data from Enphase Inverters within the Open Source Quartz Solar Forecast. I will thoroughly test this integration using authentic Enphase API credentials to ensure reliability. I will additionally deliver comprehensive example code and documentation, improving user experience and facilitating seamless execution of the forecast with genuine credentials. I will extend the project’s reach by compiling a curated list of analogous Solar Inverter companies to Enphase and write dedicated code to facilitate live data retrieval from these identified Solar Inverter systems, which will enable users to fetch live data from various solar inverter platforms and utilize it for forecasting purposes, similar to the capabilities provided for Enphase Inverters.

At the core of OHC's innovation is its flagship Electronic Medical Record (EMR) system, recognized as the 50th Digital Public Good by the United Nations. This system transcends being merely a digital repository of patient records, evolving into a platform that supports advanced TeleICU capabilities.\n\nOHC represents a unique fusion of professional expertise and community-driven innovation, primarily fueled by a small team of dedicated developers and a dynamic community of college students. This collaborative model showcases a new paradigm in healthcare technology, emphasizing impactful, sustainable, and scalable solutions.\n\nOriginally a volunteer-driven initiative during the COVID-19 pandemic, OHC has continually addressed citizen-level healthcare problems. Its CARE software, adopted by several Indian states, played a crucial role in optimizing healthcare resource management during the pandemic. As the pandemic waned, CARE evolved to support the 10BedICU Project, enabling technology-driven ICU care in rural India and providing TeleICU services to the remotest regions, impacting thousands of lives.\n\nToday, beyond the 10BedICU Project, CARE is being adopted for various healthcare applications, including palliative care digitization, demonstrating its adaptability and growing significance in improving healthcare delivery across diverse settings. OHC's journey is a testament to the transformative impact of youth-driven initiatives in healthcare, touching the lives of millions across India.",

          "abstract_html": "In any area of autonomous robotics, a simulation environment that captures a real scenario as accurately and efficiently as possible is essential for the development and testing of robots. Project DAVE operates within this context, offering a simulation platform that leverages ROS and Gazebo infrastructure and is tailored for the rapid testing and evaluation of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs/UUVs). With that in mind, the Physics-based Sonar Simulation for Underwater Robotics project is dedicated to enhancing and transitioning physics-based sonar simulation plugin to ROS 2 and the most recent LTS version of Gazebo (e.g. Harmonic).\n\nIn order to complete this project, I will first follow the migration guides from the ROS1\nto ROS 2 environment, making the necessary changes to the files of the multi-beam sonar plugin. If necessary, ROS 1 bridge package could be used to keep the system running while not everything has been transitioned to ROS 2 yet. Then the same should be done for the Gazebo version, using, for example, the available migration tutorials for modifying worlds, plugins, SDF files and so on. During the transitioning process, I must develop demonstrations and examples of how the new version of the plugin works.\n \nOnce the migration is complete, we can move on to the next step of implementation\nof half-precision calculations in CUDA in order to improve refresh rates. Currently, the\nplugin’s CUDA codes use single precision, so at this stage it would be necessary to modify in the scripts the declaration of variables/parameters and adapt the current functions to support half-precision format. \nAdditionally,  algorithm performance tests should be done to evaluate whether the changes to half-precision are functional.\n \nThroughout the process, I intend to document everything that was developed, the errors and\nsolutions found in order to offer support for future developers and users of the plugin.",

      "description_html": "Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS)  is a non-profit organization, with 37 Universities and Research Centers as its shareholders. Our main goal is to promote Openness.\nGFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance  is a platform for Open Standards, Free Software, Open Content, Open Data & Open Hardware in Greece. The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advises on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e.g. https://howto.gov.gr/ - https://forma.gov.gr/) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (https://openedtech.ellak.gr/ )",

Additionally, it is planned to explore the possibilty of using large language models in order to automatically create regular expressions to support the current workflow in two ways: First, when an already supported extraction mechanism is facing a report with structural errors, using automatic regex generators could fix the problem online. Second, using this technology would allow for the addition of many more report types to the crawler much more quickly than if it were done manually.",

These libraries will support all REST API methods, handle diverse data types, include comprehensive tests, and provide helpful examples for new users.\n\nAbout Me: \n\nI am Ahmed Hossam, a senior information technology student with a passion for technology and problem-solving. With experience in backend engineering and competitive programming, I am excited to contribute to the OBA project and make a positive impact. Investigations: I have familiarized myself with OneBusAway endpoints, built a beta version of the TypeScript package, and experimented with different structures for scalability and maintainability. \n\nDetailed Design: \n\nThe API client follows a modular structure, with each endpoint encapsulated within its own module. It employs a combination of factory and dependency injection patterns and includes a base class for foundational HTTP request functionality.\n\nImplementation Plan:\n\nI will collaborate closely with mentors to understand API client requirements and plan implementation details. Error handling and unit testing will be prioritized, followed by thorough testing and the publishing of final packages. \n\nProposal Timeline: \n\nThe timeline spans 14 weeks, beginning with communication and research in the first three weeks, followed by official coding in TypeScript. Python implementation will commence in week 9, with completion and finalization in week 14. \n\nWhy Me:\n\nI find joy in making OBA APIs accessible to everyone and am dedicated to contributing positively to the project. My experience in API development, along with continuous learning, makes me well-suited for this role.",

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [16 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

It would reduce the time invested in making the analysis work and even who are novice to command line tools to gain the benefits of Stingray. \nThe proposed solution involves creating a web-based dashboard that streamlines the process of data visualization and analysis. The dashboard will have predefined (parameter can be edited by users) functions that users can choose to analyse the data and get the required plots in the dashboard itself. \nThe aim is also to educate novice users/ UG-PG students to get to know about how the analysis is being done.

Currently, sunpy-soar offers only basic metadata, such as SOOP name, time, and level. However, there is a wealth of additional data in SOAR that is not yet accessible through sunpy-soar.\n\nTo address this, we propose adding support for various tables in SOAR, such as v_<ll/sc>data_item, v<ll/sc>repository_file, and v<instrument>_<ll/sc>_fits. These tables contain valuable metadata like filenames, filesize, sensors, and instrument-specific data. By implementing these tables, users will be able to access a broader range of metadata in sunpy-soar.\n\nAdditionally, we plan to enable querying multiple tables simultaneously to retrieve more comprehensive metadata. This involves updating the sunpy-soar/client module to support constructing queries with metadata from different tables. We will also refine the sunpy-soar/attrs module to handle new metadata attributes efficiently.\n\nOverall, the deliverables encompass the entire process of updating and enhancing metadata support in sunpy-soar, from implementation to documentation, ensuring that users can effectively utilize the improved functionality for solar data exploration.",

Currently, ndcube lacks native support for saving NDCube objects to files and loading them back, limiting its usability. To address this, the project will implement converters and schema definitions for NDCube objects and related classes ensuring compatibility with ASDF. By leveraging ASDF's flexible structure and support for complex metadata, this project will enable seamless storage and retrieval of NDCube objects with their associated metadata, enhancing reproducibility and data management. Essentially, this project will enable any NDCube object to be saved to an ASDF file and loaded back in, making ndcube more user-friendly and improving how data is handled.",

          "abstract_html": "In an era where astronomical discovery is more vibrant than ever, the significant role of data cannot be overstated. However, the diversity and complexity of these datasets often pose substantial challenges, hampering their full potential for insights. This project, under the Open Astronomy initiative and in partnership with NASA's Science Platform Initiative, proposes a novel approach to transcend these barriers using artificial intelligence (AI). The project aims to tackle the inherent challenges presented by the vast and diverse nature of astronomical datasets, including variations in temporal spans, wavelength coverages, resolutions, and depths, thereby facilitating a more cohesive and comprehensive approach to astronomical research.\n\nThe core objectives include the design and optimization of a deep learning architecture adept at processing and improving astronomical data, and conducting comprehensive testing on large samples of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) to validate the effectiveness and reliability of the proposed model. Deliverables encompass a fully developed deep learning architecture, complete with documentation and guidelines for implementation and use in astronomical data analysis, and a detailed report outlining testing methodologies, results, and a comparative analysis of data quality before and after the application of the deep learning model.\n\nThis project not only represents a significant technical achievement but also fosters collaboration within the astronomical community, building bridges between data science and astronomy. My enthusiasm for data science, combined with a commitment to open-source collaboration, aligns perfectly with the values of OpenAstronomy and the NASA Science Platform Initiative, presenting a unique opportunity to deploy AI and data analysis skills in a manner that enriches astronomical research and advances our understanding of the universe.",

The current patient flag module has performance issue as it evaluates flags sequentially, this is leading to issues when dealing with multiple flags for a patient or group of patients. I propose evaluate these flag in parallel. This approach allows multiple flag evaluations to be performed concurrently, potentially improving performance compared to sequential evaluation. Furthermore, the module currently having methods with multiple database calls, such as saving multiple flags using a for loop, causing system slowdowns. To address this issue, I aim to reduce database calls through batch saving. The patient flag module does not compatibility with Java 11 and Java 17 and this module need to update to meet the current openmrs standards. Another objective of this project is to implement the FHIR flag resource in openMRS fhir module. In the project execution phase, first updating to Java 17 and revamping the patient flag module's code base, then addressing performance issues, and finally delivering FHIR flag resource mapping.",

Still, the success of OSM wouldn't be possible without open source software and volunteer developers. The database, website and api running on our own servers, the editing tools used by contributors to improve the map, and many of the most popular libraries and end-user applications within the OSM software ecosystem are all open source software, and developed through a community-driven process.\n\nAs our Google Summer of Code participation spans this diverse set of software projects, most of which are maintained as independent efforts under the OSM umbrella, contributors will encounter a wide range of programming languages, paradigms and use cases.

We realized that and created OpenVINO – an open-source toolkit for bringing AI models to life on the most widespread and available platforms like x86 CPUs, but also Intel GPUs and NPUs that make up an AI PC. One can use OpenVINO to optimize own model for high performance with the most advanced model optimization capabilities and run those through OpenVINO runtime on various devices. \n\nWe are driven by the idea of making it easy for a regular person to learn and use AI with minimal investments and unlock innovation (such as LLMs and Gen AI) to a broad audience. We allow AI inference on the most widespread and popular platforms and provide pre-trained models, educational and visual demos, image annotation tools, and model training templates to get you up to speed. With good use-case coverage and simple/educational API, OpenVINO is also a toolkit of choice for AI in production by plenty of companies. It is a fully production-ready software solution.",

We envision a world where access to high-quality education is not a privilege but a human right. \n\nThe team works on two platforms: \n\n    (a) Oppia Web, which provides an online learning tool that enables anyone to learn from effective and engaging interactive lessons (called 'explorations'), which simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor. This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation.\n\n    (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. \n\nAs a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.",

Furthermore backend unit tests take quite long and similarly End-to-End, lighthouse and acceptance tests on the Github CI are all ran regardless of the PR's changes; all of these problems lead to developer distress. This proposal seeks to solve these problems by running frontend unit tests only on changed files and adding backend unit tests in the pre-push hook, to run similarly on only changed files. It also seeks to reduce Github CI and pre-push hook runtimes by optimizing backend unit tests.  Alongside this, this proposal will reduce Github CI usage by running End-to-End, lighthouse and acceptance tests on only PRs which need them.",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.",

The coarse resolution of PEcAn's current outputs limits their applicability for localized analyses of carbon dynamics. By leveraging deep learning techniques, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Spatio-Temporal Recurrent Neural Networks (STRNNs), this project will enhance the accuracy and granularity of PEcAn's model outputs, enabling more detailed analyses to support ecosystem management and climate change mitigation efforts.\n\nThe project will involve developing a robust data preparation pipeline to handle diverse covariate datasets, including climate variables, land cover, soil properties, and disturbance history. Time-varying covariates and disturbance events will be integrated to capture their influence on carbon flux dynamics. Tailored CNN and STRNN architectures will be designed and implemented to effectively capture spatial and temporal dependencies in the data. Comprehensive model training, evaluation, and optimization strategies will be employed to ensure accurate downscaling performance.\n\nThe developed models and workflows will be seamlessly integrated into the existing PEcAn framework, ensuring accessibility and reproducibility for researchers and practitioners. User-friendly interfaces, command-line tools, and comprehensive documentation will facilitate the adoption and usage of the downscaling capabilities.\n\nThe key deliverables include a scalable data preparation pipeline, optimized CNN and STRNN architectures for downscaling, model training and evaluation pipelines, evaluation metrics , and the integration of the developed solution into the PEcAn framework with user-friendly interfaces and documentation.",

It bridges the gap between polystores and hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) systems. In contrast to most existing polystore systems, Polypheny offers support for data manipulation queries. Furthermore, it features a flexible schema, supporting schema changes at runtime.\n\nPolypheny is a full database management system providing support for a rich set of data types. Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.\n\nMoreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows combining different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.\n\nPolypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.\n\nIn conjunction with the support for multimedia data and workloads, Polypheny offers a flexibility not matched by existing database systems.",

          "abstract_html": "The project consists of replacing the I/O Layer of pgagroal, today highly dependent on the libev library, for a pgagroal's own implementation. The so called I/O Layer is an event loop abstracted by libev. \n\nThe motivation behind this project is the fact that libev is no longer being maintained. Therefore pgagroal needs an efficient (i.e. maintainable, reliable, fast, lightweight, secure, and scalable) implementation of an event loop that can be maintained by the pgagroal community.\n\nCurrently, pgagroal depends on libev to (a) watch for incoming read/write requests from its connections in a non-blocking fashion; (b) launch timer events; and (c) watch signals.\n\nIn Linux, these functionalities may be optimally achieved by using io_uring (introduced in Linux kernel 5.1). io_uring is a communication channel between a system's application and the kernel by providing an interface to receive notifications when I/O is possible on file descriptors. io_uring is accessible to system applications through liburing, which is a library that contains helpers for the setup of io_uring. A successful Linux implementation of an efficient event loop for pgagroal necessarily utilizes io_uring -- as well as other Linux I/O interfaces (e.g. stdio) -- for efficient I/O.\n\nIn FreeBSD, these functionalities may be optimally achieved by using kqueue (introduced in FreeBSD 4.1). kqueue is an event notification interface that allows monitoring of multiple file descriptors. Like io_uring in Linux, kqueue enables non-blocking I/O operations, but it is specifically designed to fit into the FreeBSD kernel's event-driven architecture.\n\nThe objective of this proposal is to provide a plan to achieve such efficient implementations in both Linux and FreeBSD, which shall be, at the end of this program, at least as efficient as libev, but fully maintained and controlled by the pgagroal community.",

          "abstract_html": "mesa is renowned as the premier Python framework for agent-based modeling, combining powerful functionality with ease of use. However, the framework's reliance on standard Python objects to represent agents poses scalability challenges, hindering performance as the number of agents grows. This limitation renders the execution of even modestly sized models, comprising a few thousand agents, impractical. The community has long requested a more performant version of mesa. While a refactor using Cython could address performance issues, it would introduce significant complexity and require users to adapt their methods to Cython, compromising Python's simplicity. The mesa-frames initiative proposes leveraging vectorized operations on dataframes, utilizing libraries such as pandas and polars, to enhance performance and scalability. This approach benefits from the optimized, out-of-the-box operations these libraries provide and their intuitive, well-documented APIs, which simplify custom agent creation.",

Therefore, this project aims to bridge the gap between simple toy models and complex real-world issues. Hari-Plotter is based on NetworkX to handle graphs, with several classes to handle simulations and run data. During the Google Summer of Code, I will work on handling multi-dimensional opinions, different agent types encoding various behavioral patterns and clustering opinions, and I will add functionality for averaging data over multiple simulation runs.

          "abstract_html": "Effective connectivity analyses are a staple of many neurophysiological research projects, providing key insights into the healthy functioning of the brain and pathological alterations with disease. MNE-Connectivity leverages the API of the highly-popular MNE-Python signal processing package to provide tools for computing such connectivity. However, given the complexities associated with studying interactions in the brain, it is critical that the metrics for estimating connectivity are robust, and the estimates themselves statistically significant. Naturally, it is essential that such tools are available in open-source toolboxes, something we will address in this project. First, building on recent work in the MNE-Connectivity toolbox, we will implement further support for advanced multivariate connectivity metrics in the form of a dedicated decoding module. This module will provide flexible tools for the data-driven analysis of connectivity that is critical for robust characterisations of network activity in multi-channel recordings. The only comparable implementations of such methods are in toolboxes for the proprietary language MATLAB, limiting the availability of these tools to the wider research community. Second, we will expand the existing set of statistical features available in MNE-Python to include tools for assessing the statistical significance of estimated connectivity, crucial for distinguishing genuine interactions from background noise. In all cases, new features will be complemented with detailed examples and tutorials in the MNE-Connectivity documentation.

Implementing core classes from NumPy: This subtask aims to implement key classes such as ndarray and random, along with their respective methods and functionalities. The code will be written in C++ for performance benefits. Existing C++ libraries like NumCpp (or Xtensor), which offer NumPy-like functionalities, will be leveraged for the implementation.\n2. Exposing the C++ implementation to Python through bindings: To achieve this goal, we will use a library named pybind11, a popular header only library used to generate bindings for C++ classes automatically. This step will allow users to work on a pythonic frontend and access the NumPy functionalities implemented in C++.\n\nBy the end of this summer, pocketpy seeks to offer robust array operations and random number generation capabilities, positioning it as a versatile tool for various computational tasks beyond game scripting.",

The phases of this project include establishing benchmarks for existing performance with current compiler options as well as the counts and types of errors. Some work has been done so far to evaluate warnings when compiling with the TL;DR compiler options provided by OpenSSF, but more research should be done to establish candidate flags. Secondly performance analysis should be generated for candidate compiler flags. Warnings should be combed for false positives since this can impact if the work should be undertaken to fix these warnings or not use the compiler flag. Once compiler options have been selected in accordance with desired safety goals, performance analysis, and additional work needed to address warnings then tooling should be implemented to track new violations relative to an existing baseline.",

Though pocketpy has provided low-level APIs for creating Python bindings, it requires a lot of boilerplate wrapper code to bind complex C++ classes. The community has long expected a high-level solution for creating bindings. pybind11 is a header-only library that exposes C++ types in Python and vice versa, which has been widely used to create Python bindings of existing C++ code. Inspired by pybind11, this project aims to implement a compatible binding solution for pocketpy. By utilizing the template metaprogramming technique in C++17, we can extract metadata from C++ classes and functions and generate wrapper code automatically. By the end of this summer, header files compatible with pybind11 will be implemented for pocketpy. Existing pybind11 users can seamlessly migrate their bindings into pocketpy. New users can also benefit from this high-level binding solution. Additionally, we will test and verify the deliverables of the project in Cave Engine, a real-world product built on top of standard pybind11 header files.",

Afterward, ensuring the integration is correctly configured by conducting comprehensive testing to validate its functionality using pytest. To facilitate broader adoption across diverse communities, our plan is to package the bindings into a format installable via pip for streamlined distribution and usage. We will utilise Python wheels to create the package, ensuring compatibility across various platforms. Additionally, we'll employ cibuildwheel to enhance compatibility and streamline the build process. The primary objective is to make the robust capabilities of the Seldon engine accessible to Python users through efficient bindings and packaging.

          "abstract_html": "My proposal aims to increase the level of context that Pwndbg provides when stepping through a binary by “annotating” the results of instructions. Alongside the disassembled machine instructions in the dashboard, there would be text to indicate the action that each instruction takes, such as moving values between CPU registers, writing data to memory, or doing a mathematical operation. We would resolve the concrete values that memory and CPU registers take on after each instruction, providing relevant information that the user would otherwise have to fish out manually using a GDB command that varies depending on the context.\n\nPwndbg is starting to support this annotation feature for the x86 architecture. My project would add these annotations to other architectures supported by Pwndbg, namely 32-bit Arm, 64-bit Arm, RISC-V, and MIPS. This not only aids in debugging and reverse engineering, as you would gain much-needed context as to the results of instructions, but there is also an educational benefit in that you can visually see what each instruction is doing while stepping through a binary.\n\nWe would additionally create annotations for future instructions in the disassembly view using emulation. By combining the Unicorn Engine, a CPU emulator framework, with the Capstone Engine, a disassembly framework, we can provide the user with insight into the next handful of instructions, providing more context and increasing debugging efficiency. \n\nDeliverable\n- A series of pull requests which add annotations for instructions for Arm, AArch64, RISC-V, and MIPS inside the “disassembly” view of the Pwndbg dashboard\n- A rewrite of the parent class API to make adding annotations to new architectures more simple\n- Add the ability for the recursive printing of pointers inside the annotations to provide enhanced information on pointers inside heap memory, such as internal heap manager metadata\n- Documentation and tests to aid future contributors and reduce chance of regressions",

          "abstract_html": "Sometimes, in the context of quantum chemistry, the quantum state of a system in a crystal or molecule can be well described only by its occupation and/or spin operators. The goal of Model Hamiltonians, one of the APIs of the QC-Devs, is to create a framework for constructing the models and outputting them into a format that is possible for traditional Python packages solving Quantum Many-Body problems. \n\n\nIn some cases, it is more convenient to think only about the occupation number of an atomic (or functional moiety), which constitutes an occupation-based Hamiltonian. The most general occupation-number Hamiltonian we consider is the generalized Pariser-Parr-Pople + pairing (PPP+P) Hamiltonian. For some other phenomena, it’s convenient to write the Hamiltonian only in function of the spin operators. This constitutes the Spin-based Hamiltonians and can be exemplified by the Heisenberg model.\n\nOn the other hand, for some materials like superconductors, it’s necessary to combine both types of models at the same time, in a class known as occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, where the most known is the t-J-U-V model, which can be expressed as a sum of the Heisenberg XXZ and the PPP hamiltonian.\n\n\nThe package already includes implemented occupation-based and spin-based Hamiltonians. However, there is still a need for additional occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n\n\nThe primary objective of this project is to implement occupation-and-spin-based Hamiltonians, which involves the following steps:\n\n\n1. Establish a dictionary-based database to include standard constants defining various atoms and their connectivity types.\n2. Develop an API that integrates the existing code with the occupation- and spin-based Hamiltonians.\n3. Design and execute tests for the implemented API to ensure its reliability and functionality.\n4. Develop utility functions to generate model Hamiltonians in formats compatible with external programs, such as FCIDump and Triqs.",

      "description_html": "R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.\n\nR is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

This is achieved by visualizing low(er) dimensional projections of the data. As tours aren’t just singular projections, but rather sequences of projections, an integral part of the tourr package focuses on animating tours. In its current implementation, the package doesn't offer interactivity to guide the tours towards projections of particular interest. Previous efforts have been made to add interactivity; however, the resulting software suffered from performance issues or didn't provide the desired level of interactivity. Python packages such as matplotlib or tkinter offer the desired interactivity at a high efficiency. \n\nThe primary goal of this project is to develop software that seamlessly integrates the interactivity available through Python with the tourr package written in R. To achieve that, the packages reticulate and rpy2, which provide tools for interoperability between Python and R, will be used. Furthermore, a wrapper for the tourr package will be developed in Python that will make tourr more accessible to the Python community. Finally, a technical documentation as well as a vignette for the developed code will be produced.",

These articles are expected to be similar to R Journal articles in the sense of making heavy use of LaTeX markup for mathematics, algorithms, tables, etc, that would benefit from the functionality of texor.

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen works in AI, Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.\n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.\n\nSee our Ideas Page for GSoC2024. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).",

It is a unicellular organism but shows remarkable hierarchy of decisions when faced with a stimulus leading us to question whether there is some level of cognition involved and whether the line between metabolism and cognition is fuzzy implying mitochondria may be the cognitive centre \n\nFor the last 200 years research into human cognition and decision-making has revolved around rational choice theory, which assumes that actors are utility maximizers capable of searching and finding rational and optimal decisions. However human behavioral data doesn’t support the assumptions that we have infinite time nor infinite cognitive energy to search the full space of candidate choices to produce optimal decisions. Take for example a hiker, who has an infinite number of paths to choose from. It's irrational to assume that the hiker is capable of fully evaluating each of the infinite paths available to them to then choose the most rational/ optimal path. And yet that is the operating assumption for most modern cognitive models.\n\nTo remedy this, we have the Wayfinding theory which along with an optimal-control based model can be used by researchers in private and academic settings to develop more accurate computational models of cognition in various life species",

Analyse the benefits of the change.\n\nGoal 3: Employ techniques like Tandem DNN-HMMs, RNN-Transducers and WSFTs and analyse the benefits, if any\n\nAmbitious Goal 4: Employ state-of-the-art techniques to improve speaker diarization.

I hope that a formalization of my theory of energy-efficient decision making along with the open-source python library we develop can be used by researchers in private and academic settings to develop more accurate computational models of human decision making, that can be used to model agent behavior in a number of fields ranging from market behavior to crowd dynamics, along with improving LLM infrastructures.",

          "abstract_html": "Neural networks are descendants of McCulloch & Pitts' threshold-based mathematical model of a binary neuron, but there is ample evidence that unicellular organisms are capable of relatively complex maze navigation and other cognitive tasks, indicating information-processing capabilities in cellular subsystems. The task is to develop a computational model of elementary processing of analog information using Schrödinger's wave equation and Pilot Wave theory, leveraging the fact that a quantum wave function has multiple valid solutions and only one of them manifests. In Bohm & Hiley's elaboration of Pilot Wave theory, the Quantum Hamilton-Jacobi Equation can be decomposed into a classical component and a quantum component, the quantum potential. Most of the energy is in the classical component, but a small part of it is in the quantum potential. As the energy in the quantum potential is informed by and responds to the shape of the quantum wave, the process creates new information, expressed in the trajectory of the particle. The trajectory will help us take decisions. We propose two techniques, Statistical approach and Instantaneous approach. Both of the approaches use Pilot Wave theory since it is causal. For Statistical approach we will model the double slit experiment with Bohmian mechanics. The slits shape will depend on the input. We will pass many particles through the slit and take decision based on the interference pattern produced and the trajectory of the particles. In the second approach we will model the FMO complex in Green Sulphur Bacteria. Our model of the FMO complex will be used for Binary classification. There will be multiple slits in this and we will use AI to find the dimensions and location of the slits. Based on the trajectory we will take decision.",

It can take some of your time when you want to set up another meeting if you 1) Already have a tight schedule; 2) Your coworkers are in different time zones; and 3) Have to switch back and forth between the calendar and the messaging app. Hence, this project aims to streamline the process using a scheduling assistant, that can create meetings or set up a reminder using a prompt. A slash command can simply trigger it through a messaging app (in this case, Rocket.Chat). The solution will involve a lot of large language models (LLM) experiments for the user prompt. Therefore, this project can act as a semi-research in which the result of LLM experiments can be used to approach similar cases.",

In this project, we propose to develop a Rocket.Chat app that enables the AI programmer functionalities where users can utilize the tool to create a short piece of code in C/C++, Java, Javascript, Typescript or Python based on specification supplied by the user. This implementation includes modern open source LLMs (Mistral, CodeLlama, WizardCode, Llama2, Phi, and so on) for a simplified configuration. This functionality also allows users to ask for a new variation of the code or augment/fine-tune the system for a more precise code generation. To achieve this, we propose to design a more intuitive and interactive UX to simplify users’ interaction. Finally, we will explore to bridge the generated codes with sharing APIs, allowing them to be shared to external applications and added to GitHub as a pull request. The AI Programmer app will be published on Rocket.Chat Marketplace together with specified documentation.",

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

The outcome will be the ability to use effect system monads through the async[[X] =>> Monad[R, X]] syntax, facilitating easy composition of various effect systems.

It supports JVM-based applications, utilizing Java2D for rendering, and for web browsers through SVG support. The library operates on a principle of composition (i.e Retained mode), enabling users to craft visuals by combining various elements. Doodle supports differences between backends through its tagless final architecture. \n\nDoodle currently supports retained mode graphics. Retained mode graphics involve representing the image as a data structure, creating a hierarchy of elements where each element relates to others. While this facilitates expressing parts of the image in terms of others, it poses challenges with large numbers of elements, making alignment difficult and memory usage proportional to the number of elements. On the other hand, immediate mode graphics represent the image as a function for drawing it. This method consumes memory proportional to the algorithmic complexity (Kolmogorov complexity) of describing the image. In immediate mode, we can have a single drawing context and can be used for high volume graphics. This enhancement will allow for more interactive experiences, opening up new possibilities for creative expression and application development. Further on, we wish to add advantages of the immediate mode, while retaining the advantages of retained mode. Combining both the methods can be very crucial for the developer willing to involve both the modes in a single method.",

This graph maps to a variety of high-performance architectues and performance engineers can manipulate this graph for achieving state-of-the-art representations. When dealing with large projects with hundreds of thousands lines of codes the state graph can become extremely unreadable due multiple nested cycles, function’s calls, and conditional branching: it becomes nearly impossible to understand smaller parts of the graph and it also makes relating it to the original source code very hard. \n\nTo mitigate this problem the concept of ControlFlowRegion was introduced. A ControlFlowRegion is a region of the SDFG which represents a control flow construct just like a traditional programming language. An example can be the LoopRegion, developed on a separate feature branch (loop_architecture_pt_3), which represents the classic C-like for loop for ( init-clause ; cond-expression ; iteration-expression ). \n\n\nThe project goal is to \n- Implement all the other control flow constructs like if … elif … else and match\n- Implement regions for function calls and with statements\n- Implement user defined regions\n- Add support for all these new regions in the DaCe VSCode extension",

Given a Btor2 instance, Btor2-Select selects and applies the expected best verifier(s) from a pool of hardware and software tools. These decisions are based on various machine learning (ML) models, trained upon historical performance data, mapping from instance features to algorithm selections.\n\nWe proposed two embeddings for Btor2 instances: bag of keywords and bit-width aggregation. Two traditional algorithm-selection ML models, i.e., empirical hardness model and pairwise classifiers, were implemented in Btor2-Select. More importantly, we developed a novel algorithm selection and scheduling framework based on deep reinforcement learning (RL). This RL framework allows for adaptive algorithm selection throughout the solving process, leveraging dynamic information such as previous attempts and elapsed time. Upon evaluation, the adaptive algorithm selector outperformed the best non-portfolio solver (SBS) by 24.4%. Moreover, it closed 6.69% more SBS-VBS gaps than the best non-adaptive algorithm-selection method, a common performance indicator for algorithm selectors.\n\nAll the codes, experiments, and data can be found at: https://gitlab.com/sosy-lab/software/btor2-select.",

There are three levels for BLAS: Level 1 is for vector-vector operations, Level 2 is for vector-matrix operations, and Level 3 is for matrix-matrix operations.\n\nI propose to add the Javascript, C, and free form Fortran implementations for the routines using the fixed form Fortran implementations available. For each package, I will add thorough benchmarks, comprehensive test suites, examples, and a README containing the API signatures for the routine in multiple languages, along with the ndarray case. I will also add the docs folder, which houses a repl.txt file, a typescript file that provides introductions, usage instructions to aid in documentation, and other files to check cases where the function may become invalid. A cblas wrapper will also be added for devices with support for cblas, such as AppleAccelerators, for hardware-optimized performance.\n\nThis implementation will open doors for domains such as time series analysis or linear algebra operations such as SVD that are built on top of these BLAS routines. A comprehensive suite of BLAS routine APIs will be incorporated into stdlib, and the integration of C and Fortran implementations will aim at optimizing performance and enabling potential hardware-based implementations.",

To address these issues, I propose a comprehensive solution aimed at reducing the learning curve for instructors and enhancing the functionality of autograding systems. The project focuses on three primary areas: Firstly, I aim to improve autograding examples by creating tailored solutions for specific use cases, such as evaluating compilation speed and handling distributed/networked applications. These examples will feature detailed configurations in config.json, accompanied by comprehensive documentation. Additionally, existing examples will be revamped to meet current standards and encompass a broader range of programming languages and features. Secondly, I will enhance documentation and provide illustrative examples for new autograding features that lack proper guidance. Through thorough research and collaboration with mentors, I will develop demonstrations for features like generating random input/output and utilizing customized Docker containers. The aim is to facilitate understanding and usage of these features by instructors. Lastly, to provide instructors with a user-friendly platform for configuring autograding across various educational levels, I will establish a structured repository. This repository will house a diverse array of autograding examples organized by educational level, ranging from introductory to advanced courses. Furthermore, I will encourage crowd-sourced contributions to create a comprehensive collection of programming assignments and exercises, complete with their autograding configurations. To streamline the contribution process and ensure consistency in configurations, I will implement GitHub Workflow Actions. The repository will include detailed documentation and guidelines to facilitate contribution and usage.",

The Submitty system currently does not have a user-friendly way of viewing student grades for the instructor or TA. This creates an issue for the instructor in being able to clearly see how their students are doing in the class, trends in which problem sets might cause issues.

It will start with implementing an efficient ABC parser for MusicBlocks, ensuring robust extraction of musical information from ABC notation. Next, the project will tune and benchmark the LLM to generate high-quality musical compositions in ABC format. Once tuned, the LLM will be deployed to a server environment, and API endpoints will be set up to enable interaction with MusicBlocks. Users will initiate compositions in MusicBlocks, which will be sent to the LLM for enhancement. The LLM will generate multiple compositions based on the user's input, which will be converted back to MusicBlocks format for further enhancement. Throughout the project, integration testing and flow testing will ensure seamless interaction between MusicBlocks and the LLM API. Comprehensive documentation will provide insights into the implementation process, results of benchmarking and testing, and recommendations for future improvements. This integration of AI-generated compositions into MusicBlocks aims to inspire creativity, deepen musical understanding, and enhance the learning experience for users",

          "abstract_html": "The Music Blocks v4 project is a complete overhaul of the original Music Blocks project, which was derived from the Turtle Blocks project. The existing implementation, which started in 2015 using native Vanilla JavaScript, lacks modern front-end tooling and ecosystem standards, leading to difficulties in maintenance and subpar performance. The v4 project uses improved application architecture, modern tools (such as Vite, ESLint, Prettier, Docker, Jest, Cypress, etc.), better languages (TypeScript and Sass), and libraries (React for UI rendering). This will significantly enhance the overall developer and user experience, maintainability, and performance. The proposal focuses on implementing one of the main features of Music Blocks, the \"Masonry Framework\" (previously code-builder/project-builder), which is currently missing in the new version (v4). The is a graphical blocks manager module used to create Music Blocks programs, including interactive blocks like Start, Rhythm, Note, Pitch, Instrument, and many more. These blocks can be dragged, dropped, and clicked to perform actions or open context menus. By implementing the Masonry feature end-to-end, users will be able to create different musical patterns seamlessly. This will bring the v4 project on par with the capabilities of the old version (v3) and provide a more accessible, efficient, and user-friendly application for users to create music through an interactive web application.",

While this provides concise code and avoids repetition of common paradigms, understanding the source code can become harder if it is unknown what the macro expands to.\n\nVisual Studio Code using the Swift Extension currently has limited ability to show the code generated by a macro by invoking a code action that replaces the macro by its generated code inside the current source file.\n\nThe project’s goal is to implement a code action to show the macro-generated code without modifying the current source file. This includes the implementation of a request in sourcekit-lsp to compute the contents of the macro expansion and support in the Visual Studio Swift Extension to display that content.\n\nAs a stretch goal, Visual Studio Code should also offer semantic functionality like jump-to-definition inside the macro expansion and allow the expansion of nested macros.\n\n*Deliverables*:\n1. An Expand Macro Code Action in VS Code that shows the generated contents of a swift macro in a peeked editor\n2. Support for Semantic Functionality such as jump-to-defintion, hover, syntax highlighting in the peeked editor\n3. Allow expanding macros generated from macro in the peeked editor i.e. Nested Macro Expansion\n4. Add a standard request support for other LSP-based editors giving them ability to expand macros upto the first level.",

These modules allow users to set up models of physical systems and automatically generate the corresponding equations of motion. In SymPy, these equations can be derived using two primary methods: Lagrange's Method and Kane’s Method. This automation greatly simplifies the process of deriving these equations. However, as models grow more complex, the computational cost of generating the equations of motion can increase significantly, highlighting several opportunities to improve the performance of SymPy’s routines. My goal during this project was to identify these performance bottlenecks through benchmarking and community feedback, and to develop solutions that ensure SymPy remains efficient even with large and complex systems.

      "description_html": "TARDIS is a tool that creates synthetic observations (spectra) for exploding stars (supernovae). \n\nA supernova marks the brilliant death throes of a star, during which it outshines its entire galaxy. Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\n\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).

          "abstract_html": "Understanding photon-ion interactions within ejecta is crucial for interpreting astronomical spectra. While the TARDIS SDEC plot visualizes which ions photon packets interact with, it lacks information on where these interactions occur within the ejecta. This information can be extremely useful to astronomers who want to understand which regions of the ejecta are responsible for important features in the output spectrum. \nThe project addresses this issue by developing a visualization tool that plots the number of photon packet interactions as a function of velocity for each element present in the ejecta. It involves obtaining interaction data post-simulation, creating an interactive widget comprising spectrum selection, ion frequency display, and velocity histogram, and it is stored in a dedicated class.\nThe project will deliver a fully functional interactive widget designed to visualize photon-ion interactions by velocity, significantly enhancing astronomers' ability to interpret astronomical spectra. This widget will provide users with a comprehensive understanding of the regions within ejecta responsible for specific spectral features. Alongside the widget, the project will also produce a suite of thorough test cases ensuring the accuracy and functionality of the tool. Additionally, comprehensive documentation will be provided, offering detailed guidance on implementing and utilizing the visualization tool effectively. This documentation will serve as a valuable resource for users seeking to integrate the tool into their research workflows.",

      "description_html": "ENIGMA is a game development environment comprising an IDE, Compiler, and Game Engine. \n\nENIGMA is meant to be simple to learn and even simpler to work with. ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.\n\nUsers write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.\n\nThe compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.\n\nTo really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.",

          "abstract_html": "The current FreeBSD system call creation script was implemented to streamline the introduction of system calls into the FreeBSD kernel. It’s a monolithic script, converted from awk to Lua, and has kept much of the procedural-oriented awk code. It does not take full advantage of modern features of Lua (object-oriented design) and is difficult to extend. The goal is to strip the current script into an easily extendable interface. It will utilize classes to give extensible methods to objects, mainly utilizing the facade and command design patterns, to give a more \"bite-sized\" interface to the previously procedural code. This will allow easier maintenance of the Lua tables and procedures, and a better platform to add more. Lua modules will provide better namespacing of globals, dynamic generation of output files,  and more modules with different tasks may be easily added. After refactoring, the previous functionality of the original script can be achieved simply by calling the necessary modules. The benefit to FreeBSD is further streamlining in the creation of system calls, a more maintainable interface, and a strong foundation to build upon in the development of future system call creation tools. It will further demystify the process of system call creation and allow others to more easily contribute. Deliverables are (1) system call creation will work as before; (2) the monolithic script will be refactored into core, modules, and classes; (3) a system call creation library that is easily extensible; and (4) well-documented with conventions used.",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2024 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University, Boise State University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and Singapore University of Technology and Design.\n\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well-separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

First, there are too many unconfirmed results. Even though we provided correct results, we’re losing points because these results cannot be verified by witness validators. To address this, we should support generation of violation witness in a format that witness validators can verify. Second, there are incorrect results. To deal with this problem, we will analyze why SPF outputs wrong answers for certain task and repair SPF to work correctly. In addition, we will categorize why SPF outputs some incorrect results.",

In this project, we aim to implement various components of the ColBERT model, with the major focus on indexing and search. Being a late-interaction retrieval system, ColBERT isolates all the computations between the queries and documents to enable pre-computing the document embeddings offline. Combined with a RAG pipeline as an embedding and retrieval backend, ColBERT can make the usage of existing AI tools really powerful. As part of the project, we also aim to apply this model to Julia's own extensive documentation (over thousands of packages), and integrate ColBERT with AIHelpMe.jl and PromptingTools.jl. Combine this with a locally hosted LLM, all Julia users get a powerful, modular, and easily hackable local AI assistant, allowing them to integrate ColBERT with their own RAG pipelines.\n\nThe main deliverable of the project will be a new package (called ColBERT.jl), with the implementation design inspired from the original Python implementation of ColBERTv2.0 (i.e the centroids + residuals compression method). The project will also have an extensive number of addons, including, but not limited to, implementing the training module for this package, which will allow users to train their own ColBERT models instead of relying on pretrained checkpoints, and distributed training (using existing art like DaggerFlux.jl).",

The current proposal addresses the need for improved functionality in windowing, support for the display of super voxels, faster load times, and robust viewing of multiple images. By leveraging Rocket.jl and ModernGL.jl, the proposal plans to implement features like enhanced windowing for MRI and PET data, support for the display of super voxels, and high-level functions for improved user experience. The project aims to streamline visualization processes and provide essential tools for 3D medical imaging workflows.\n\nThe main deliverables include:\nSupporting simultaneous visualization of multiple registered medical images, with linked scrolling, cursor highlighting, and connecting lines between annotated points across images.\n\nImplementing automatic windowing and colormaps for common MRI and PET imaging modalities to provide consistent visualizations mimicking other medical imaging software.\n\nAdding support for visualizing supervoxel segmentations with boundary detection using techniques like the Sobel filter.\n\nImproving startup time by precompiling critical components of the package.\n\nImplementing high-level functions to simplify basic usage by abstracting away low-level details of image loading, rendering, and visualization.\n\nBy enhancing MedEye3D.jl with these features, the project aims to provide a more comprehensive and user-friendly tool for 3D medical image visualization and analysis within the Julia ecosystem. The improvements will facilitate better integration into medical imaging workflows and enable more efficient exploration and interpretation of data across different modalities.",

This is not very accessible for the actual target group\nof scientists & engineers who are used to program in high-level languages such as Python, MATLAB and Julia.\nAdditionally, it requires manual labour (rewriting symbolic expressions, then\noptimizing them, and finally translating the resulting code back to the\noriginal language) due to the necessity of interfaces to interoperate between different systems written in different languages.\nWe propose to take advantage of Julia's homoiconicity and powerful existing symbolic-numeric ecosystem to implement an automatic floating point expression optimizer in Julia, acting on any expression that supports TermInterface.jl, such as Symbolics.jl expressions as well as native Julia code.\n\nThe project will include a package that implements the floating point expression optimization apporach (OptiFloat.jl). To achieve this Metatheory.jl will be fully integrated with Symbolics.jl, enabling e-graph based optimization of any symbolic expression (not just numerical). Additionally we will finalize the release of Metatheory.jl v3.0,\nidentify existing Julia packages that may suffer from numerical error propagation, and perform a thorough comparison of automatically optimized expressions vs. original vs. external system including the time required to obtain them.",

As a summary, \n\n(1) Initial weeks are spent getting familiar with Turing best practices while building out 50+ of the simplest models (mostly, variants of Bayesian regression).\n\n(2) Weeks leading up to the midterm assessment are blocked off for GLMMs and Bayesian ODEs.\n\n(3) Weeks following the midterm assessment are dedicated to two types of discrete models — first, models with a discrete structure amenable to simply summing out the discrete components (e.g. mixture models). Second, I'll implement HMMs, which require some specific algorithms to match the Stan posteriors.\n\n(4) Chip away at remaining models that don't neatly fit into a specific category, for example, neural networks, splines, and gaussian processes. \n\nIf a week ends with models incomplete, I'll move on to the next week, ensuring a varied selection of models make it into the database.",

However, there are other embedded Linux OS updaters, such as SWUpdate and RAUC, that are based on an A/B partition update scheme, for which there is no support from Uptane\n\nThis GSoC project would contribute to Aktualizr's implementation of support for an A/B partition-based update method, preferably integrating with SWUpdate or RAUC. This would enable the manufacturers who use A/B based updates to be able to utilise the security features offered by Uptane and thus ensuring a wider user support for Uptane.",

It does not only cover many printers to give them support under Linux and free software operating systems at all, but also is optimized for highest possible print quality, so that at least on some printers and with the right settings you can even get better print quality than with the original (Windows/Mac) drivers. Right Now We only have retrofitting application that supports gutenprint so we need Native Gutenprinter application.\n\nSolution to the Problem - Here We create a native printer applcation by using pappl and libgutenprint library. Here on an incoming get-printer-attributes IPP request we call the same functions which the PPD generator calls, but instead of translating the responses into a PPD file we translate it into the IPP answer for the get-printer-attributes request. And when we have a job to print, we call the library functions which the filter calls, but directly. \n\nMy task to implement above is - \n - Create a PAPPL-based Printer Application using the libgutenprint library and PAPPL\n - Make sure all options and parameters of the Gutenprint driver are accessible from the Printer Application's web admin interface.\n - Package the Printer Application as a Snap\n\nDeliverables - My goal is to deliver a native printer application  from Gutenprint.

It is written in a device tree source (.dts/.dtsi) file, which is compiled into the kernel image at build time. This structure provides a standardized way to describe a system’s hardware topology. Device Tree bindings are the rules and conventions used to describe devices within the Device Tree. These bindings define how to represent various hardware components.\n\nDevice tree bindings were historically written in human readable (.txt) format and developers had to rely upon manually reading these files and writing device tree source files accordingly. Now, these files are being converted to DT schema (.yaml) format so that semantic validation can be done on device tree sources automatically.",

          "abstract_html": "The proposal outlines a comprehensive plan to enhance the model's accuracy and efficiency, coupled with new user interface (UI) integrations. First, the optimization of machine learning and statistical models will focus on Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), feature reduction, feature engineering, and employing better imputation techniques for handling missing data. This will streamline the process and improve model performance.\n\nAdditionally, fine-tuning a rule-based system will involve adjusting and normalizing feature weights, alongside providing users with tailored recommendations based on our analysis. Another key objective is the integration of new datasets. Currently, each dataset requires different handling, and by incorporating a new dataset, we aim to deliver more refined insights.\n\nTo address data imbalance, techniques such as minority class upsampling and additional data generation methods will be applied. This ensures the model can better handle unbalanced data distributions. Fraud detection is also a critical focus, with plans to identify suitable datasets and initiate the development of robust fraud detection capabilities.\n\nLastly, improvements in federated learning will be made to ensure data privacy and efficiency, allowing the model to learn from decentralized data without compromising individual data security.",

          "abstract_html": "The project focuses on the enhancement and refinement of a feature-rich and secure Mobile Wallet application tailored for Government to Person (G2P) payments, demonstrating a potent tool for fintechs and financial institutions. Originating as a Google Summer of Code initiative from 2017-2023, the project delivered the initial mobile wallet framework, evolving into a sophisticated reference application with two primary apps: PixieCollect and MifosPay, later consolidating focus on MifosPay. The developmental trajectory of the project saw significant milestones: integration with Mojaloop transaction flows, user experience enhancements, support for Kotlin, and implementation of standing instructions and merchant transactions.\n\nFurther advancements include integration with Fineract CN, multi-theme support, migration to Kotlin, and a transition towards a multiplatform approach using Kotlin multi-platform. The project aims, in 2024, to finalize G2P functionalities, ensuring production-readiness, improving security, and adopting modern development practices such as Jetpack Compose and leveraging Mifos' Android SDK. It underscores a commitment to evolving into a generic wallet management system through the Mifos X framework, incorporating cutting-edge features like the latest Payment Hub EE version, a new notifications framework, and a redesigned architecture to align with the Open Wallet Foundation's principles. This ambitious endeavor promises to redefine the landscape of mobile wallets, emphasizing security, extensibility, and a seamless user experience for G2P payments and beyond.",

The Android client will become the first Mifos app to utilize the Fineract SDK, thereby reducing redundant network layer code.\nThe upgrade will involve two main migrations: transitioning from XML to Jetpack Compose and supporting a multi-module MVVM architecture organized by feature-wise modules. Additionally, the project will include supporting Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP).\nThe upgrade will also encompass implementing unit and integration testing for features and upgrading the CI/CD pipeline for KMP and Google Play Store release pipelines. Integrating the Google Play Store API will streamline the release flow, leading to a more stable and error-free codebase, faster build times, and an improved developer experience. These changes will also facilitate smoother release management and upstream contributions, ultimately reducing the time required for upgrades.",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008.  The simulator is written in C++, with bindings for Python scripting, and uses the CMake build system.  We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and Zulip chat, but typically not other social media.",

Additionally, improving the ease of use of multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) approaches aims to enhance the usability of NR Sidelink, enabling distributed operations.\n\nIn this project, I will improve the interface between OpenGymEnv in ns3 and ns3env in the Python ns3 gym module for Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Currently, ns3gym utilizes the REQ-REP pattern in ZeroMQ as the interface.

This feature allows checkpointing containers within Kubernetes pods, and, with some additional steps, restoring them on a different node. This approach preserves active TCP connections of the container. However, workloads (e.g., web servers) with established TCP connections to the migrated container cannot make use of this feature, as the container IP changes after migrating to another node. This project implements a P4-based load balancer on the data plane that dynamically reroutes packets to the correct IP address after container migration. The goal is to make the migration invisible to the client, causing only a period of service unavailability, after which communication can be resumed without re-establishing the TCP connection. Deliverables of this project include a P4-based load balancer, control plane code for P4 runtime interaction, a minimal CNI plugin for Kubernetes integration, and performance benchmarks to demonstrate the system's effectiveness.",

A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\n\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed.\n\nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\n\nSince 2019 we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also felt these organizations often faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.\n\nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the open source software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site cloud hosted service as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills to do so independently. We hope that our contributors will help us achieve this goal.",

          "abstract_html": "Rustfmt, the de facto standard tool for formatting Rust code, has been reported that it occasionally fails to format silently. One of the major causes is that the internal formatting mechanism loses the context when issues occur during formatting. While rustfmt heavily relies on the Rewrite trait to format various AST structures, the rewrite method, the only method that consists of the Rewrite trait, returns Option. This makes it hard to track how and why formatting failed. To improve handling of silent failures and allow rustfmt to retry formatting under more contexts, this project aims to refactor the Rewrite trait so that errors occurring in formatting can be propagated.",

While the project is already quite feature-rich, it still can't compile Rust tests properly. This project will focus on adding all the features necessary for such tests to run, with the end goal of running them within the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\nAdding those features will not only enable running tests, it will also improve the project, enabling it to compile far more Rust programs.\r\n\r\nAt the end of GSoC, this project will deliver the following features:\r\n\r\n1. Support for parsing command line arguments in Rust programs running within the .NET runtime. \r\n\r\n2. Implementation of atomic intrinsics needed for `std` argument parsing to function properly. They should be implemented using cross-platform .NET APIs, but using architecture-specific functions may be needed to properly handle certain atomics.\r\n\r\n3. Support for dynamic trait objects - creating them, dropping them, calling their member functions.\r\n\r\n4. Support for catching panics, implemented using the .NET exception-handling primitives.\r\n\r\n5. Support for multithreading: launching threads, and getting information about them.\r\n\r\n6. Extended .NET interop, automatic creation of safe GC handles for managed objects. This feature is necessary for safely handling .NET threads, but will be exposed in the `mycorrhiza` interop layer, provided by the codegen. \r\n\r\n7. Fixes to string formatting. This feature is necessary for reporting test results. At the end of this proposal, simple formatting, such as `format!(\"my string is:{string}\")` should run within the .NET runtime.\r\n\r\nThe end goal of this proposal is running a simple cargo test within the .NET runtime. This test will consist of two cases: one failing, and one passing.\r\n\r\nAll the deliverables mentioned above are strictly needed for achieving that goal.",

Traditional autograding systems often provide generic feedback, which may not be sufficient for students to grasp the root causes of their errors and improve their coding skills effectively.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, the project proposes the development of a sophisticated system that can analyze code submissions comprehensively. This system will consist of custom drivers designed for each programming problem, capable of detecting various types of errors and providing tailored explanations for them. These explanations will cover not only low-level syntax errors but also higher-level issues such as algorithmic design flaws or incorrect usage of data structures.\n\nMoreover, the project includes the creation of an intuitive interface with a structured roadmap covering programming topics from basic to advanced levels. This interface will offer a gamified learning experience, complete with progress indicators and visual feedback mechanisms to keep users engaged and motivated. By integrating the custom drivers and feedback pipeline into this interface, the project aims to provide a seamless learning experience for users at all skill levels.\n\nUtilizing open-source tools like Monaco code editor and Judge0 for code execution ensures compatibility and accessibility across different platforms. Additionally, the project emphasizes continuous feedback and refinement through interactions with mentors, instructors, and users. This iterative approach allows for the continuous improvement of the system, ensuring its effectiveness in assisting learners in understanding programming concepts and improving their coding skills.",

Throughout the process, I will deliver one C source code implementing compression configuration settings, one C source code implementing lossless and lossy algorithms, a set of performance reports before and after data compression in CSV and standard output files, and a technical documentation on h5bench user manual website.",

          "abstract_html": "LLM hallucinations have been tackled using various techniques, including modern retrieval methods such as  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAGs). These techniques show that combining non-parametric memory, which is retrieved and ranked from sources like knowledge graphs and/or databases, with the LLMs' parametric memory helps generate less factually incorrect information. However, hallucination explainability still remains unsolved, especially on logical reasoning tasks. Additionally, the impact of uncertainty caused by these hallucinations on human trust and decision-making still remains unexplained.\n\nTo address these problems, we propose two solutions: 1. Conduct a first-of-its-kind study that develops a new conversational explanation paradigm under compositional uncertainty and performs human evaluation. 2. In parallel, develop a neuro-symbolic framework for explaining hallucinations in large language models by utilizing agentic Prolog knowledge-base rules.\n\nTo accomplish these objectives, we first build a lightweight full-stack web application that collects quantitative and qualitative human feedback for model alignment. We also design LLM explanation paradigms grounded simultaneously in multiple sources (open and closed source), develop models (LLMs and agents), and build a pipeline for storing the human feedback in common data format to a secure database, which can be used to further adjust the weights of the reward model.",

The main reason this does not happen is because the Unikraft bootable images are missing the Linux header.\n\nThe first step will be reading documentation and familiarizing myself with the project. I would estimate that this step will take about two weeks. The Linux x86 Boot Protocol will be studied and questions will be asked towards the community and the mentor. \n\nSecondly, a step for planning ahead the workflow that will dictate the way I will work on the project (two weeks). By doing this, a schedule will be set in place that will help me always be on time. Design the structure of the external program to parse bootloader metadata and generate the Linux Boot Protocol header. Comparing the x86 header to the ARM64 one could highlight  certain common traits that can be used to minimize the existent code.\n\nFinally, the coding period will start that will be summed up by taking feedback, discussing unforeseen problems, striving to meet deadlines. This will take approximately twelve weeks. At this time, the best course of action is to respect the planning done before and focus on integrating everything that can be picked from the UEFI script.

From supporting the first version of Multiboot, being able to boot through the Linux Boot Protocol on ARM64 and having its own UEFI stub enabling the Operating System to load without a Bootloader, Unikraft has still a lot to learn with respect to the booting environments it knows.\n\nOne such booting protocol that would be very useful is Multiboot2. This protocol represents a significant improvement over Multiboot version 1, providing improved flexibility in the realm of bootloaders. A notable improvement is the extended information provided by Multiboot2, which provides detailed and accurate communication between the bootloader and the operating system kernel during the bootstrapping process. In addition, Multiboot2 comes with a standardized tag system, enabling easier data and system configuration parsing between the bootloader and the kernel and allowing greater interoperability and better integration of boot modules. The introduction of optional commandline further enhances the flexibility of the boot process. Together, these enhancements contribute to a more robust and scalable bootstrapping mechanism, making Multiboot2 a better choice than Multiboot version 1.\n\nConcretely speaking, it would allow us to boot directly in 64-bit mode, while having access to pointers to the UEFI tables as well as the ACPI tables, unlike Multiboot 1, offering us access to more modern firmware interfaces. The task at hand involves integrating the Multiboot2 definitions as well as its corresponding bootstrapping code into Unikraft. Auxiliary scripts may be implemented to allow the automatic creation of Multiboot2-based Unikraft bootable images.",

By introducing this feature, VLC users will have the flexibility to create plugins in their preferred programming languages, streamlining the plugin development process and expanding VLC's capabilities.

Currently, there's no clear way to do this, leading to inconsistent accessibility practices.\n\nMy solution involves five main parts that are also my deliverables:\n\n(1). StreamField Block for Images: I will create a new block specifically for images that includes an alt text field. This ensures editors don't forget to add alt text.\n(2). Modifying the Image Model: I will add an \"image description\" field to the existing image model. This provides more flexibility for alt text.\n(3). Writing tests.\n(4). Updating documentation.\n(5). Exploring the use of AI to generate alt text suggestions (as a stretch goal, along with some other stretch goals in the PDF I attached).\n\nI plan to achieve the first two goals by building upon the pertinent Pull Requests I have already drafted at the time of writing this. Goals 3 and 4 will follow each of the first two goals closely, and I have commenced research on integrating AI models with inspiration from the Wagtail-AI GitHub repository. For goal 5, I plan on working hand in hand with the A11y team.\n\nThis project will make Wagtail sites more accessible for visually impaired users and improve overall accessibility compliance.",

          "abstract_html": "I propose to work on the creation of a DMA-BUF backend for waycrate’s libwayshot screen capture library. Presently libwayshot’s method of screen-capture requires copying from graphics memory to system memory via CPU using the shared memory methods of the wlr-screencopy protocol. This method has too much overhead for uses like high resolution streaming: any further transforms and processing of the image will either be performed on CPU (inefficient) or require another copy back onto graphics memory. There is a better way to do this.\n\nThe DMA-BUF (short for Direct Memory Access Buffer) is a Linux kernel framework that allows for efficiently sharing buffers of memory between multiple graphics devices or subsystems. Using the DMA-BUF export mechanisms in wlroots we can completely avoid downloads and uploads between graphics memory and the CPU, thus allowing for increased efficiency and performance. This will be especially noticeable on higher resolution screen-captures where individual frame buffers become too large to be efficiently dealt with on a CPU compared to how they can be handled on the GPU.\n\nThe Deliverables for this project are: Complete implementation of a high-performance DMA-BUF based screen capture backend in libwayshot, Documentation for using it.",

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.\n\nOverview\nCurrently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).\n\nWhat makes webpack unique?\nExtensibility webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.\n\nFocused around Web Performance webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.\n\nBuilt in JavaScript webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.\n\nUsed at Scale webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.\n\nCommunity Owned webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only.",

Take natural language queries and convert them to structured queries using the GoaT query syntax.\n2. Automatically select the most appropriate type of search to perform and return results as a natural language statement.\n\nThis will improve the overall user experience and abstract the complexity of the GoaT syntax from the end user.",

The app goes beyond traditional resources by utilising sound, touch, device sensors, and interactive elements to create a multi-sensory learning experience. This approach aims to improve engagement, understanding, and retention of key mathematical concepts. \nThe proposal highlights my strong interest in accessibility software solutions, a relevant background in Android development, and a desire to use technology to make a positive social impact. Through my research, I have demonstrated the use of existing accessibility tools and outlined a comprehensive project plan that includes:\n1.)Interactive modules: Lessons on basic arithmetic, cardinal directions, trigonometry, geometry, metric systems, and more. The modules thoughtfully leverage device features like magnetometers, gyroscopes, and accelerometers.\n2.)Story-based learning: A story mode with auto-generated MCQs potentially using TensorFlow Lite for comprehension and assessment.\n3.)Accessibility focus: Thorough consideration of screen reader compatibility, audio and haptic feedback, and support for Braille displays and switch access.\n4.)Iterative development: A detailed timeline with a community bonding period, regular milestones, testing, and a phase for incorporating user feedback.\nThe idea of this proposal aligns closely with Zendalona's mission.",

Currently, some services only provide object ID in their webhook payload, not human-readable data. Some integrations also require users to download a script to be integrated, which is not ideal for non-technical users. To address these issues, I propose adding a proper callback system by extending the bot model and providing an additional UI for configuring the integration details. I also plan to improve several integrations by implementing newer features such as the proposed callback system and provide maintenance for ones with outdated payloads.",
