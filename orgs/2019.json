Our goal is to foster innovation in the field of geoinformatics by organizing and facilitating a collaborative software development process. The topics we address comprise for example sensor web technologies, the web of things, linked open data, spatial data infrastructures, citizen science, earth observation, and 3D. This selection of topics reflects both the strengths and strategies of the partners involved.\nSome of our software projects are enviroCar, 52°North SOS, 52°North JavaScript Sensor Web Client, ILWIS, and 52°North WPS. Check out our GitHub organization and our Ohloh page to learn more about the wide range of software our communities work on: from mobile apps to standardized web services, from cutting edge research to established products. 52°North open source projects are used in a broad range of domains (e.g. oceanology, air quality, hydrology, traffic planning) and operational as well as research projects (e.g. European Horizon 2020 projects such as NeXOS, FixO3, WaterInnEU, ODIP II).\nAll of the 52°North software is published under an OSI approved open source license.\n52°North GmbH, which is the legal body and service center of the network, acts as a non-profit organization. This means that the shareholders of 52°North do not receive profit shares or payments from company funds. Instead, the profits earned by 52°North are completely re-invested into the innovation and software development process.</p>\n",

A system can be considered complex when its consisted of more sub-systems and when nonlinear interactions between its various design parameters and sub-systems are present. Optimizing such systems can be a challenge for human designers who can neither directly identify optimal design points nor manualy investigate a large design space to identify optimal solutions. In order to tackle this problem, algorithmic optimization approaches are required. Genetic algorithms can successfully navigate a large and nonlinear design space but their performance is highly dependent on the selection of various hyper-parameters. At its current form the optimization problem is concerned with the design of an electric propulsion unit for small satellites. This project aims in the development of visualization tools that will aid in better understanding such complex optimization processes. By developing visualization tools for the optimization process and the sub-systems' characteristics the algorithm's performance can be further enhanced and new insights that can prove valuable for human designers can be identified.</p>\n",

The \"Knowledge, reasoning and planning\" section and “Uncertain knowledge and Reasoning” section was partially implemented last year. Implementation of the “Learning” section is not initialized yet. Therefore, as a part of my GSoC proposal, I plan to implement the <strong>Learning</strong> section of the textbook. Depending on the advice from the mentor, I would also be interested in making APIs for the <strong>Knowledge, reasoning and planning</strong> and <strong>Uncertain knowledge and reasoning</strong> sections of the textbook for AIMA4e branch. I also plan to add the explanatory notebooks for these sections. I’ve already worked on some notebooks before, hence would love to contribute to the same.</p>\n<p>Besides this, I  plan to write the tests for updated algorithms of the fourth edition and demonstrate these on the various problems as done in the <a href=\"https://github.com/aimacode/aima-java/tree/AIMA3e/aima-gui/src/main/java/aima/gui/demo\" target=\"_blank\">demo</a> package of aima3e branch.</p>\n",

Used in tandem, these tools allow one to fuzz test shader compilers for flaws and easily reproduce them.</p>\n<p>The generator mutates a shader by performing \"transformations\" on the original code which complicate control/data flow.

It's solution boils down to having a robust and real-time end user experience.</p>\n<p>This proposal is about core optimisations and addition of new and exciting features to the user experience of the React application. That implies, using Server-side Rendering for faster page loading times (significantly low Time To First Byte), using web-sockets for real-time updates for incidents, comments and HTTP Long Polling for upvotes etc., migrating to more robust, scalable and available database solution, finally, decoupling it from Django views. Then we need to write consistent tests to validate different models and fields. Finally, an NFSW image classifier. Eventually, we will end up with cleaner code, sound application architecture of both frontend and backend, adding more tests and developing/revamping new features are the most obvious ones. This will not only make developing new features much more easier, cleaner and maintainable but will also dramatically improve user experience and take it to next level.</p>\n",

This most commonly appears as pronoun resolution where we need to identify the antecedent in the source context. Apertium works with resource-poor languages and the information available isn’t as linguistically complex as parse trees. Hence there is a need for a tool which resolves anaphora using simple linguistic information.</p>\n<p>Instead of the current system, which chooses a default male for pronoun resolution, this tool will use linguistic features to assign saliency scores to the possible antecedents. The highest scored antecedent is picked for possessive, reflexive, zero pronouns and long-distance relations like agreement in adjectives. This formalism is language agnostic and the features make use of only POS tags and basic gender and number information. I will test it on Spanish, Catalan, English, Russian, French, etc.</p>\n<p>When implemented, this tool will increase the fluency and intelligibility of the Apertium Translation Output of any pair it is used with. It has several interesting future prospects, such as using language specific linguistic features, and general coreference resolution.</p>\n",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Paradigm</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a> (OSL), RGB/spectral/mixed rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<h3>Ecosystem</h3>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya and Autodesk 3ds Max. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n<h3>Timeline</h3>\n<p>appleseed was founded in May 2009 by François Beaune, a former rendering engineer from the core R&amp;D team at mental images (now NVIDIA).</p>\n<p>In October 2011, the development of appleseed benefited from a technology sharing agreement with Jupiter Jazz Limited and received funding for one year. Since October 2012, appleseed relies on the continued effort of talented volunteers.</p>\n",

The ability to autonomously detect a power failure and safely execute an autorotation will add a greater level of redundancy to the ArduCopter firmware.  This will aid in making traditional helicopters safer to operate, reducing the risk of harm/damage to people, property, and the unmanned vehicle itself.<br>\nMy secondary goal is to develop the functionality without loss of generality, maintaining its applicability to all helicopters.\nContained within this proposal is a review of previous work done by others.  Following this, preliminary investigations show that main rotor head momentum is a critical factor.  A methodology is proposed to scale a generic velocity trajectory using the main rotor head momentum in hover.  The trajectory will be empirically determined through SITL and real-life testing.  The resulting flight mode will provide a robust approach to completing an autorotation manoeuvre for any helicopter.  An overview plan of how development time will be allocated, over the GSoC period, is presented.  Finally, a short section detailing my background follows.</p>\n",

We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.</p>\n<p>We have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration platform; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.</p>\n",

It is based on a system that now needs\nmajor changes.\nA lot of research has been done in adaptive cloth simulation (which is the next big step towards\nbeing able to do realistic cloth simulation in reasonable computation time). By introducing adaptive\ncloth simulation into Blender, we can decrease the computation time per frame, thereby leading to a\nbetter quality of simulation in the same amount of time. Furthermore, it would then be possible to\nbuild really powerful cloth production pipelines. The current cloth production pipeline is slow and\nrequires a lot of user interaction (for example, for adding the correct level of topology and\nredefining the stitches each time the topology changes). With the introduction of adaptive cloth\nsimulation, the algorithm can automatically determine the necessary topology to get the correct\ncollisions and realistic folds and wrinkles. Additionally, this project would act as the base for future\nimprovements, such as adding contact friction and dynamic tearing of cloth.</p>\n",

Traditional Expression templates are efficient but Klaus Iglberger showed in his <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1104.1729\" target=\"_blank\">work</a> that traditional ETs (Expression Templates) does not automatically result in faster execution of the expression. Smart expression templates are a tool for capturing the expression, possibly transforming and evaluating the expression. For better expression evaluation I will use  <a href=\"https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_69_0/doc/html/yap.html\" target=\"_blank\">Boost.YAP</a>, a C++14 and later expression template library. Boost.YAP already offers a lot of functions and algorithms for dealing with expressions. It will ease my task moreover most of the issues pointed out in the paper cited above are efficiently handled by YAP. Hence, this proposal aims at the integration of Boost.YAP for convenient expression template transformation and evaluation in <code>boost::numeric::ublas::tensor</code></p>\n",

However, there is still much to be done to get to a peer review ready state. I propose to optimize the memory usage of Real. By changing the way real_explicit stores numbers, we can reduce memory usage of real_explicit by an order of magnitude. Utilizing std::variant, we can reduce the memory used by a real number to that of either a real_operation, real_explicit, or real_algorithm. I propose to better the way Real deals with operations, in particular, by simplifying sums of multiples of the same number. Further, I propose to implement benchmarking using Google Benchmark, to allow direct comparison between Real and other representations. After this, Boost.Real may be ready for peer review.</p>\n",

LibreCAD 3 was designed to have multiple rendering engines without major modifications to its core. \nRight now LibreCAD 3 uses Cairo for rendering. For users with high resolution screens, Cairo is not convenient because of a slowness, due to a bad integration with Qt and a missing caching system. At each frame when rendering is done the data is sent from CPU to GPU which is very inefficient.\nOpenGL has lower CPU overhead for draw calls and state changes and lets you take advantage of the GPU to render graphics on your device's screen and performance is excellent.\nThe project consists of replacing Cairo with OpenGL in LibreCAD 3.To make a complete well abstracted OpenGL implementation  with C++ for the rendering in LibreCAD.</p>\n",

This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world. Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

An inconvenience for both biologists trying to get valuable information to make informed decisions on prognosis and patients who would like to readily have access to this information for their own comfort, is the time needed to access this data. As the genomic data sets for each study vary in size, viewing annotations for studies that have large data sets in real-time is a challenge because it takes a while for the information to load. For example: MSK-IMPACT 2017 has a data set of 10,000 samples, so it will take a few minutes for the study view to load. I would like to work on the three backend tasks and first frontend task. This means pre-annotating the mutation data and storing it into the MySQL database and creating an additional column in the mutation table called “annotation”. Querying and using the web API to provide the information needed to solve the front-end goal of creating pie charts for oncogenicity and highest level of sensitive therapeutic implications per sample.</p>\n",

If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.</p>\n<p>While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.</p>\n<p>In addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: JokerTV integration, YouTube TV/Hulu support, AI, rclone, cloud, and a few more that are starting to take shape.</p>\n<p>The best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics &amp; technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.</p>\n<p>We’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 7th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment. If you want to be a part of such community and help achieve our goals, come join our Slack group or mailing list!</p>\n",

The primary method through which this synchronization will be done is through syllabic analysis. Applications exist where the number of syllables spoken in an audio file can be extracted without processing the words themselves, resulting in much faster runtimes. By similarly analyzing the number of syllables in a chunk of text, a process for which several very good algorithms exist, we can roughly match the timestamp of each syllable in the audio file to the corresponding syllable in the lyrical text. This process would take place in a separate module than the actual SwagLyric application so as to facilitate speed of retrieval when the user is actually streaming. Several obstacles, which will be discussed in more detail, exist: these include stripping away background music and getting specific audio information from Spotify’s stream.</p>\n",

The HEP Software Foundation (<a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/</a>) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, <a href=\"https://home.cern\" target=\"_blank\">https://home.cern</a>) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (<a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider</a>) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

Dedicated physicists and engineers have constructed a system that has served the collaboration well, but the approaching HL-LHC upgrade, which will produce about an <em>exabyte</em> of data per year, demands a more economic solution. Fortunately, the HEP Software Foundation (HSF) has been collecting data describing global and local access patterns that can be used to model the response of alternative, novel infrastructures that may better serve High Energy Physics for decades.

Not only is a Kalman Filter more reliable about predicting future state than traditional extrapolation techniques, It also provides a confidence for the estimate. A Kalman Filter is used both to reduce the impact of sensor noise on estimations, and to determine which sensors can be “trusted” more than others. Whereas more primitive methods for estimation and extrapolation rely on some form of averaging, a Kalman Filter forecasts by developing a weighted covariance for each sensor input.</p>\n<p>The aim of this project is to implement a Kalman Filter in Rust. Rust has gained popularity for providing more compile-time checks than other systems-level languages, namely C and C++. Rust’s memory model ensures that there is little to no room for many of the memory pitfalls common in other low level languages, such as double-freeing memory, dangling pointers, and user-after-free errors. This, in conjunction with high runtime performance, leads writing components of a codebase in Rust to be favorable for both speed and stability.</p>\n",

In this project, two other libraries that can be used with CGAL are considered: OpenGR and pointmatcher. Although OpenGR has a wrapper to work with CGAL types, it suffers from duplication of the point type due to lack of proper abstraction layer. For pointmatcher, there does not exist a wrapper, i.e., an interoperability channel to use its ICP method on a CGAL point cloud that global registration is applied. The first goal of this project is to introduce an abstraction layer around point and normal type for the OpenGR library, so that, CGAL types can be directly used.

The k-dop whose facets are determined by hyperplanes with outer normals in a fixed number of directions is a generalisation of the bounding box, and it is promising to be more efficient and flexible than the AABB tree in the intersection search.

For example, they can be used in terms of benchmarks to determine the variance of a processed geometry from a given ground-truth model.</p>\n<p>One such similarity measure is the Hausdorff distance. Given two compact subsets A, B of a metric space, the one-sided Hausdorff distance between A and B is defined as the distance between an element a from A and an element b from B, where a is chosen to maximize the distance and b is chosen to minimize it. Intuitively speaking, the Hausdorff distance measures the maximum deviation between two models.</p>\n<p>The project consists of implementing the algorithm for interactive Hausdorff distance computation presented by Tang, Lee, and Kim. While it provides an approximation to the Hausdorff distance - as already present in the CGAL framework - it ensures the computed measure to be within a user-specified error bound. Thereby, the user can obtain as good results as necessary for the applications at hand within a fast and efficient pipeline.</p>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting Chapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the cloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed. Chapel's design and development are being led by Cray Inc. in collaboration with academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique experience for students to work on projects involving high-performance computing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<h4>Native Parallelism</h4>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel provides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a separate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism features make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and program.</p>\n<h4>Data and Task Locality</h4>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task which uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in performance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that placement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<h4>Multiresolution Philosophy</h4>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to initially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until they are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<h4>Modern Language Features</h4>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design, type inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<h4>Interoperability</h4>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or vice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Checker Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.</p>\n<p>Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count = \"hello\";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

The (2) psycholinguistics group studies the effect of cochlear implantation on child language acquisition. This description focuses on (3) the computational linguistics group.</p>\n<p>Current research at CLiPS' Computational Linguistics Group focuses on developing tools that can extract data from social media messages, such as fine-grained sentiment analysis, and the detection of subversive behavior on social network sites (sexually transgressive behavior, hate speech, ...). Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.</p>\n<p>Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.</p>\n",

We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>We are building a platform called <em>EvalAI</em> as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need of evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.</p>\n",

In contrast to the supervised learning setting where performance is measured by evaluating on a static test set, it is less straightforward to measure generalisation performance of these agents in the context of the interactions with the environment. Evaluating these agents involves running the associated code on a collection of unseen environments that constitutes a hidden test set for such a scenario. The goal of this project is to set up a robust pipeline for uploading prediction code in the form of Docker containers that will be evaluated on remote machines and the results will be displayed on the leaderboard.</p>\n",

It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.</p>\n<p>of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.\nFor Users</p>\n<p>coala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.\nFor Developers</p>\n<p>You can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.\nFor Newcomers</p>\n<p>coala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.</p>\n",

This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell.</p>\n<p>Our technologies have broad impact in education: Traditional didactic and textbook-based learning formats utilized in many life sciences courses create an environment that limits student ability to develop highly needed technical skills and fully conceptualize the complex and dynamic nature of biology and diseases. To address these challenges, our software technologies enable students ranging from high schools to undergraduate and graduate levels to learn about biology and diseases using by building, simulating, breaking, and re-analyzing computational models of these biological systems.</p>\n<p>Other technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.\nOur group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.</p>\n",

Primary issue is bloat of irreclaimable memory due to pipe-pages. Pipe buffers are pinned in memory making them non swappable. Pipes have maximum size restriction, so there could be many pipes which results in memory pressure during pre-dump process. Replacing pipe-pages with userspace supplied buffer from CRIU will alleviate this memory pressure. Since, the buffer pages can be swapped out.</p>\n<p>Another issue is duration for which pre-dump algorithm freezes the target task. Use case like live migration expects smallest possible freezing glitch. So, objective is to reduce this freeze time during pre-dump.</p>\n<p>To achieve both of these objectives, we use process_vm_readv system call with a set of VMA-list gathered by freezing target task for minimal amount of time. There are challenges in handling memory areas with this approach, like race conditions resulting in false reads. Development of graceful solution for these challenges is objective of this project.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>D is a programming language with an emphasis on powerful metaprogramming facilities on top of a robust, efficient core. Idiomatic D programs are commonly as fast as hand-optimized C code, while being reportedly shorter and easier to write, read, and change. A gradual approach to memory safety allows safe programs to be largely automatically checked, whilst relying on small and fast manually-verified primitives.</p>\n<p>Metaprogramming in the D language relies on three core features. First, <em>compile-time evaluation</em> allows user code to evaluate most D code (except calls into opaque functions or certain casts) during compilation. This allows for unparalleled compile-time processing abilities, without the need to learn a different metalanguage. Second, <em>static introspection</em> allows D artifacts (such as modules, types, functions) to be inspected during compilation. This allows for component designs that adapt to one another at assemblage time, eliminating the rigidity of fixed interfaces - a paradigm becoming increasingly known as \"Design by Introspection\". Third, the D language allows strings computed during compilation to be fed back to the compiler. This allows arbitrarily complex code to be built from compact specifications such as regular expressions, EBNF/PEG grammars, SQL, automata, and many other DSLs. Each of these three pillars is enabled by the others, and the absence of any one of them would hamstring the power of the others.</p>\n<p>D's rich feature set offers many opportunities to a variety of projects, without them being ostensibly related to advanced metaprogramming facilities. High-performance code can be terse and highly optimized without the tedium of repeated coding patterns or hand-written specializations. Highly dynamic code can combine static and dynamic language features in an expressive whole. The best, most innovative ways to use the D language are yet to be discovered.</p>\n<p>You can learn more about <a href=\"https://dlang.org/overview.html\" target=\"_blank\">D's feature set and design at dlang.org</a></p>\n",

One way of solving both of these problems is by moving runtime hooks to use templates instead.

In these three steps, predicate detection, a core component of this process, identifies the KB relation(s) a question refers to. To build a predicate detection structure, we identify all possible named entity first, then collect all predicates corresponding to the above entities.

Entity linking is a process of ontology alignment or ontology mapping between source and target ontology. In this workflow, the goal is to detect similar concepts/classes or instances/individuals between the source and target ontology. There are two levels of linking, the first one is schema level linking and another one is instance level linking. Schema level linking is mapping/alignment between concepts/classes of the source and target ontology and on the other hand, instance level linking is mapping/alignment between instances/individuals of the source and target ontology.</p>\n<p>This proposal presents an approach for ontology alignment through the use of an unsupervised mixed neural network. In this workflow, we will explore reading and parsing the ontology and extracting all necessary information about concepts and instances, generating semantic vectors for each entity with different meta information like entity hierarchy, object property, data property, and restrictions and designing User Interface based system which will show all necessary information about the workflow.</p>\n",

At the core of an operating system is the kernel. The kernel is the most fundamental program on the computer and does all the basic housekeeping and lets you start other programs.</p>\n<p>Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel or the FreeBSD kernel.</p>\n<p>However, work is in progress to provide Debian for other kernels, primarily for the Hurd. The Hurd is a collection of servers that run on top of a microkernel (such as Mach) to implement different features. The Hurd is free software produced by the GNU project.</p>\n<p>A large part of the basic tools that fill out the operating system come from the GNU project; hence the names: GNU/Linux, GNU/kFreeBSD, and GNU/Hurd. These tools are also free.</p>\n<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 51000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other utilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as easily as installing a single application. All of it free.</p>\n<p>It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian — carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.</p>\n",

Drupal has great standard features, like easy content authoring, reliable performance, and excellent security. But what sets it apart is its flexibility; modularity is one of its core principles. Its tools help you build the versatile, structured content that dynamic web experiences need. It's also a great choice for creating integrated digital frameworks. You can extend it with any one, or many, of thousands of add-ons. Modules expand Drupal's functionality. Themes let you customize your content's presentation. Distributions are packaged Drupal bundles you can use as starter-kits. Mix and match these components to enhance Drupal's core abilities. Or, integrate Drupal with external services and other applications in your infrastructure. No other content management software is this powerful and scalable. The Drupal project is open source software. Anyone can download, use, work on, and share it with others. It's built on principles like collaboration, globalism, and innovation. It's distributed under the terms of the GNU (GPL). There are no licensing fees, ever. Drupal will always be free. The Drupal community is one of the largest open source communities in the world. We're more than 1,000,000 passionate developers, designers, trainers, strategists, coordinators, editors, and sponsors working together. We build Drupal, provide support, create documentation, share networking opportunities, and more. Our shared commitment to the open source spirit pushes the Drupal project forward. New members are always welcome. Drupal 8 is the biggest update in Drupal's history. Creating content is easier. Every built-in theme is responsively designed. It's available in 100 languages, and its integration tools make it a great hub for complex ecosystems. More than 4,500 people, companies, and organizations contributed their time, experience, and imagination.</p>\n",

Currently majority of geospatial data exploration happens in stand-alone applications like Panoply and NcView, tools that have limited functionality, do not provide complex analysis methods and can only be reasonably extended by the software developers on those projects. This new tool, written in Python, but presented as a dashboard in the notebook environment, will be extendable directly by researchers by using it in conjunction with tools like Dask and will also provide complex analysis methods on the data being visualized. It holds the promise of saving Earth Science and other researchers significant amounts of time since they can directly focus on visual data analysis and research rather than writing custom code to explore data.</p>\n",

Especially in heavy rain, rain streaks from various directions accumulate and make the background scene misty, which will seriously influence the accuracy of many computer vision systems, including video surveillance, object detection and tracking in autonomous driving, etc. Therefore, it is an important task to remove the rain and fog, and recover the background from rain images. It can be used for image and video processing to make them clearer and it can be a preprocessing method for many computer vision systems. We propose to implement this technology in FFmpeg. For video, this proposal proposes to utilize the relationship between frames to remove rain and fog.

Firstly, the project needs the development of the program modes in the Android application so that the user can select between the formers and get to launch the application and receive output/feedback accordingly. Then comes the development of the Audio and Visual Feedback features for the application. Now while developing these features it needs to get all the bases covered by coding all the possible classes (java files) and function modules for handling the background processes which can be achieved by taking some inspiration from the Neurophlex project. Animations need to be integrated and the app shall need UX/UI improvements for a better in-app experience. Details of the development process are further in my proposal.</p>\n",

Being a NodeJS powered framework specifically designed to create desktop apps, Electron happens to be the right choice for the job. While shifting to Electron, we will re-implement the existing functional / broken features ( all the tools available in PSLab desktop are not functioning as of now, which I have verified using a physical hardware ), redesign the UI /  UX flow, and take a more modular approach for development. At the core of the app, we will still use the PSLab-python library for device communication. As Electron apps are developed using JS, we can expect a more enthusiastic developer crowd to join the cause. A much more thorough documentation for the same is also available. Making use of Electron will also allow us to cherry pick modern looking UI libraries to give our user base a much more fluid experience. Finally I would make use of the easy to use packaging system of Electron so that users can easily install PSLab desktop with a single click instead of using the current install scripts.</p>\n",

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu/fndrupal/\" title=\"FrameNet\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet</a> initiative, a global effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. \nFrame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is  the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h3>The Database</h3>\n<p>FN-Br implements a <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" title=\"FN-Br database\" target=\"_blank\">relational database</a> storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes data about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h3>The Applications</h3>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based annotation tool <a href=\"http://webtool.framenetbr.ufjf.br\" title=\"Webtool\" target=\"_blank\">Webtool</a>, a domain-specific dictionary - the <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/world-cup-dictionary/\" title=\"FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary\" target=\"_blank\">FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary</a>; a system for recommending tourist attractions - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/m-knob/\" title=\"m.knob\" target=\"_blank\">m.knob</a>; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/software/carma/\" title=\"CARMA\" target=\"_blank\">CARMA</a>.</p>\n",

There are various metrics that are available to evaluate the quality of translation but most are obtained by computing the similarity between an MT hypothesis and a reference translation based on character N-grams or word N-grams. Using the data generated from the annotation of the TED Talk in two or more languages, as well as the relations between frames given in the Berkeley FrameNet Data Release 1.7, our task for this project is to build an automated metric system for machine translation, which is intended to measure the frame distance between sentence pairs in two languages. In this proposal, the task has been modelled as a regression task of predicting accuracy scores. The frames evoked and the related frame network has been used as pivotal features of the model.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>FreeBSD is an advanced operating system for modern server, desktop, and embedded computer platforms. FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 4 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD Project began 25 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a team of nearly 90 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.</p>\n",

However, it is clear that lncRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, and lncRNAs are thought to have a wide range of functions in cellular and developmental processes. There are many specialized lncRNA databases (like RefSeq, GENCODE, Ensembl, SGD, tair). We will use Machine Learning techniques to highlight and compare two sets of calls (of Ensembl / GENCODE and RefSeq) and determine which calls are incorrect.\nGoal of the Project: Implement a machine learning model (a 2nd pass filter) which will predict / validate credible calls (true positive/false positive cases) produced by RefSeq and GENCODE (or Ensembl).</p>\n",

This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

The only way to do this now is by using empi from the science overlay and empi has its shortcomings such as lack of multilib support and was not ported to the main tree. In my proposed plan, a new MPI framework ported from existing MPI applications is introduced to enable Gentoo to use multiple MPI versions and relevant packages depending on them (for example, HPL). The new MPI framework is mainly based on ‘Modules’ package together with Gentoo Prefix technique for detecting, choosing or manipulating MPI environment. Also, a new implementation of mpi.eclass is introduced and the packages can still be emerged normally onto the system without any trace of mpi.eclass being used. The approach also enables users to easily work with different implementations at the same time without any special privileges. In order to solve the defect that empi does not support multilib, the new framework also adds support for allowing the environment to be configured and installed into different places among different architectures (amd64, x86 etc.).</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Currently, the Google-Backend for GVfs supports only a subset of operations allowed by Google-Drive on the web-interface. The major problem with supporting all the operations is because of the difference in how POSIX systems handle files whereas how a database-backed system like Google-Drive handles files. This difference results into limitations as to what operations can be performed with the current libgdata API. Since, each file’s identifier is its ID, i.e. “name” equals ID, we have to specifically use “display-name” for storing a file’s title, which is what is shown by nautilus.</p>\n<p>Simply copying/moving files from one folder to other folder results into an error “Operation not supported” so as to preserve the file’s title. Copying/Moving is one of the fundamental operations that should be possible on a file. My ultimate goal with this proposal is to add support for this necessity and make the Google-Drive backend more usable.</p>\n",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

The demodulation of the B-CNAV1 navigation message of BEIDOU B1C will open the door to innovation in multi-constellation receivers.\nAlong with the fully functional implementation of a GNSS receiver working with BEIDOU B1C signals, this project will help to address topics such as integrity, reliability, robustness, enhanced coverage, and high-accuracy positioning. Additionally, the integration of BEIDOU B1C observables into the position, velocity, time (PVT) solutions will allow the achievement in a diverse range of applications and components.</p>\n",

The performance obtained with such architectures is sufficient for benign propagation scenarios, but typically deliver poor performance under harsh propagation conditions. Code and carrier tracking, as well as joint code/carrier synchronization, can be formulated as an estimation problem which can be solved using Bayesian filtering methods. It has been shown in the GNSS literature that KF-based synchronization solutions can be used to overcome the performance limitations of standard approaches, offering implicitly adaptive filter bandwidth, and opening up the possibility of using nonlinear models to avoid certain limitations associated with the use of code, phase or frequency discriminators. In this contribution, we will leverage powerful nonlinear tracking algorithms, including cubature, unscented, and sigma point Kalman filters in order to produce realizations of carrier and joint code-carrier tracking blocks which promise to be more effective and adaptable in challenging GNSS environments when compared to traditional architectures.</p>\n",

It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.</p>\n<p>What is Software Radio?\nThe <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software-defined_radio\" target=\"_blank\">Wikipedia page</a> on Software Radio provides an excellent overview. In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!</p>\n",

In addition, Hackage Matrix Builder is one of the project that aims to provide the best build compatibility test service to the Haskell community for all the packages published on Hackage.</p>\n<p>In this project, I am aiming to make a full-stack Haskell web development project example as well as adding UI feature in Hackage Matrix Builder to maximize its purpose as QA or CI service for everyone.</p>\n",

It uses Hydra(W3C draft) standard for creation and documentation of its APIs. This proposal aims to improve hydrus and extend its functionality. As we want to make hydrus reliable and complete, we will need to at least provide all the basic functionalities a Hydra-compliant API Documentation can describe. As we are planning to create a testbed in hydra-python-agent to test whether a server is Hydra compatible or not, it makes sense to first make hydrus compatible with Hydra so we can test it. So besides extending the functionality of hydrus, this project includes refactoring hydrus and making it completely compatible with Hydra specification.</p>\n",

Expanding the data available would aid hypothesis generation in the C.elegans research community, by allowing fast access to past observations and by facilitating the generation of more robust models through model validation tests such as SciUnit. However, ultimately it could also be a poster child to inspire an increase in standardisation and statistical accountability in the publication of biological research as a whole.

We deal with the question of how the software development process can be improved. Through visualizations we make the abstract problems of software development more understandable and accessible. In recent years, we have built up a great deal of knowledge in this field and published at international scientific conferences together with scientists from all over the world. Since last year, we have concentrated to put scientific findings into practice. Our innovative open source project <a href=\"https://github.com/getaviz/Getaviz\" target=\"_blank\">Getaviz</a> transfers the knowledge of the scientific community of software visualization into helpful tools for software developers. With the support of our growing community we are designing visualizations for exploring the structure, behavior, and evolution of software artifacts in 2D, 3D, virtual reality, and augmented reality.

      "description_html": "<h3>What is InterMine?</h3>\n<p>InterMine integrates data from diverse biological sources, and provides a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our <a href=\"http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries\" target=\"_blank\">client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript</a>.</p>\n<h4>What technologies do we use?</h4>\n<p>The InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.</p>\n<h4>What sort of data does InterMine have?</h4>\n<p>Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own organisms, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the <a href=\"http://registry.intermine.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InterMine Registry</a> to see them all. (The registry was a GSoC project!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.</p>\n<h4>What kind of problems does InterMine solve?</h4>\n<p>Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! We aim to help scientists make sense of such ambiguity, diversity and complexity.</p>\n<p>One way to help is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes?</p>\n<p>Code you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, we aim to write code that can be easily deployed on any of them.</p>\n",

However, setting up an instance of Intermine is a time consuming and error prone process. It also requires technical knowledge and some familiarity with Java, Postgres and shell scripts. These issues create a barrier for entry and friction in the adoption of intermine by the bioinformatics community. To solve these problems, Intermine team is planning to create a cloud platform that offers managed Intermine instances. This will remove the technical burden from the user and greatly simplify the creation of intermine instances. Also, the work done on Intermine cloud can easily be translated to simplify the creation of Intermines locally.\nThis project forms a part of the Intermine cloud project. It includes packaging of intermine and it’s components in docker containers,  cloud infrastructure setup, orchestration of containers, authentication, and authorization on the cloud.</p>\n",

Moreover, the test suite will be broken up into unit and integration tests. Support for querying with the Registry class will be added. Docs for both libraries will be added (adding end-user docs for <code>imjs</code> and developer docs for im-tables). Build system of both the libraries will be investigated, and the possibility of updating it will be discussed and implemented (possibly in the GSoC period itself, if feasible as per investigation).

          "abstract_html": "<p>The Wayback Machine archives billions of webpages, with vast numbers being added to the collection every day, including news sources. Though the crawling operations are quite successful, there is still work to be done to improve the quality of webpages archived by checking for “broken” or “bad” pages. I propose developing a methodology to assess the quality of news sources, both in terms of bias/factual reporting and in terms of technical viability such as geoblocking, paywall blocks, and CAPTCHAs. I will then use this methodology to create a tool that can automatically assess quality and take an appropriate action, perhaps preserving an error message and reason for failure in the Wayback Machine. This tool will ideally be integrated with the Wayback Machine’s web crawlers. I will also use my findings to develop recommendations for circumvention tactics, such as paying for subscriptions to important news sources or negotiating agreements with CAPTCHA services to allow the Internet Archive, as a public good, to bypass the CAPTCHA. The goal of the project is to develop a system to think about the quality of archived webpages and then create tools to automate quality assessment.</p>\n",

The ISC team has helped write those standards, as well as implement them. The Internet infrastructure projects we work on present very interesting problems, including performance, interoperability, flexibility, resilience, security, and even user experience. Major carriers and service providers use our software - as do schools, airports, hospitals and small businesses. <strong>Working on core infrastructure gives you an opportunity to have a significant impact. </strong></p>\n<h4>Our Team</h4>\n<p>BIND 9 and Kea are maintained by full-time senior engineers with a lot of experience in networking and software development.  We have to have high standards: coding standards, code reviews, continuous integration testing, continuous fuzzing, continuous performance testing. ISC's engineers work from home, wherever they live, which is all around the world.  We keep in touch with on-line chat mailing lists, and frequent video conference calls.</p>\n<h4>How You Could Contribute</h4>\n<p>BIND 9 and Kea are fairly large and complicated software projects, but both need more than we can provide: we need to improve our usability, we have lots of ideas for useful tools, we need better documentation, and we have many features we would love to add.  If you look at our user mailing lists or our GitLab issue trackers, you will see we have an active and vocal user community. Besides contributing directly to the main BIND or Kea projects, there are many other possible projects - including dashboards for metrics and status, configuration tools and maintenance and testing utilities.</p>\n",

In the current implementation of KDE Partition Manager, all the privileged tasks such as executing some external program like btrfs, sfdisk etc. Or copying a block of data from one partition to the other, which requires escalated permissions to execute are executed by a helper non GUI application. So, instead of running whole GUI application (KDE Partition Manager) as root or superuser, a helper non GUI application is spawned which runs as root and executes privileged tasks. This helper program communicates with KDE Partition Manager over simple DBus protocol. The current implementation may seem a good idea, but is not, the reason being that KAuth is an extra layer added over Polkit-qt which causes extra overhead.\n So, the proposal for this project is to port all the authentication/authorization code from KAuth to Polkit-qt without effecting the original behaviour of KDE Partition Manager.</p>\n",

SDDM used in conjunction with Plasma, however, results in certain issues, some of which fall under the guise of consistency between the login screen and the desktop. In practice this means that as soon as there is any relevant veering from Plasma defaults, the login manager no longer provides an identical visual experience. This GSoC project would try to solve that very issue by adding the possibility of syncing the desktop and login manager options. Options that could be synced are: color scheme, font, font size, font rendering, icon theme (obtained from the Plasma theme). Rather than adding discrete options, the suggestion is to have only one option that would pertain to syncing SDDM settings with a particular user’s settings. Patching SDDM to support Plasma wallpapers would also fall within the scope of the project. Most importantly, because desktop display scaling preferences are likewise not respected in SDDM, the project would also tackle the issue of allowing users to set a display scaling preference via GUI.</p>\n",

I am also planning of packaging the application for various Linux distribution using their respective packaging system as well as Snap and Flatpak, for Windows and eventually for macOS. In addition, I would like to write documentation explaining how to use the application with the aim of including a tutorial showing how to write the KDE neon ISO images on a USB drive using KDE ISO Image Writer which could then be added to the KDE neon download page.</p>\n",

In digiKam, tags on photos are strongly supported for the sake of providing users with a natural workflow of searching and arranging photos in their collections. Since many of our photos contain faces, face tag has apparently emerged as an essential property for any photos management software, also with the fact that user has to tag thousand of their photos manually. Being aware of that, digiKam team has put a lot of efforts to develop face engine, capable of scanning photos and suggesting face tags automatically basing on pre-tagged photos by users. However, that functionality is currently deactivated in digiKam, as it is slow while not adequately accurate. Thus, this project aims to improve the performance and accuracy of facial recognition in digiKam by exploiting state-of-the-art neural network models in AI and machine learning.</p>\n",

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.</p>\n<p>Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.</p>\n<h4>What is Céu?</h4>\n<p>Céu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there. Liquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly. The Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open source software both improving its administration and enabling open source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.</p>\n",

These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</li>\n<li>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.

Functions attributes can be either given by the frontend or be inferred by LLVM. There are some attributes which can not be inferred now. If we could infer them, more optimization would be done.\nIn addition to this, there are a lot of problems in current implementation. First of all, each algorithm is very similar but implemented separately. If we extend these implementations to infer other attributes, there would be a lot of code duplication and it is hard to maintain consistency. Therefore, it is better to replace them with a more designed implementation. We have a new framework for deducing attribute called “Attributor” developed by Johannes Doerfert. So I propose to extend this framework and deduce attributes.</p>\n",

This is true both in standard compilation but also link-time-optimization (LTO) in which the module is (partially) merged with others in the same project at link time. LTO is able to take advantage of this to optimize functions calls to outside the translation unit. Code compiled without LTO for all of its dependencies, however, does not have this information and therefore is unable to perform such optimizations. To remedy this issue, one might propose always compiling programs with LTO enabled. This doesn’t solve the problem for two reasons of practicality: LTO comes with a nontrivial compile-time investment; and many libraries upon which a program could depend, do not ship with LTO information, simply headers and binaries. In this project, we propose solving the problem by generating annotated versions of the source code that also include this derived information. Such an approach has the benefits of both worlds: allowing optimizations previously limited to LTO without running LTO and only providing headers.</p>\n",

Its core essentially interprets C, C++, Objective C or Objective C++ code, and at several program points allows it’s modules, or checkers to emit reports. Later, it will construct a bug report, that shows how the error can be reproduced. These steps (such as that the analyzer modeled a call to function, assumed a variable is positive, etc.) are collectively referred to as a bug path. Ideally, this contains every information needed to reproduce the error, but is minimal. However, it can contain either too little or too much information.</p>\n<p>In my proposed project, I indent to use static backward program slicing to enhance bug report generation. Instead of doing a fix-point algorithm on the control flow graph (CFG) though, my solution would be implemented on the abstract syntax tree (AST).

In reality this is overkill,  as most of the packages on the MacPort do not need the full installation. To phase out this dependency, several things should be done:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Xcode dependency flag</strong>: implement a flag for package maintainers to indicate Xcode dependency</li>\n<li><strong>Xcode dependency detection</strong>: implement a way to detect Xcode dependency when building packages using sandbox tracing</li>\n<li><strong>Force build without Xcode</strong>: blacklist Xcode compilers when Xcode is not needed by hacking libxcselect</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This will lay the groundwork to eventually phase out Xcode dependency for MacPorts as a whole. All contributions are made onto the <strong>macports-base</strong> repository,  touching various areas of the codebase and overall adding features to the Tcl-based command line tool.</p>\n",

However, the currently deployed version is outdated and fails in several aspects due to the absence of some key features such as:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The ability to write custom JavaScript views (UI components).</li>\n<li>Triggering a build whenever a pull request is made. Currently, a build can be started only when patches are committed to the master branch.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>This has led to some major setbacks with respect to developer productivity. MacPorts also needs some custom views in buildbot to be able to better analyze build history, commits, etc. The legacy version doesn’t allow us to write such custom views. This project will involve upgrading the Macports Buildbot infrastructure to the latest version, developing a plugin for buildbot and writing custom views.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>While the Internet has far exceeded expectations, it has also stretched initial assumptions, often creating tussles that challenge its underlying communication model. Users and applications operate in terms of content, making it increasingly limiting and difficult to conform to IP’s requirement to communicate by discovering and specifying location. To carry the Internet into the future, a conceptually simple yet transformational architectural shift is required, from today’s focus on where — addresses and hosts — to what — the content that users and applications care about.</p>\n<p>The Named Data Networking (NDN) project aims to develop a new Internet architecture that can capitalize on strengths — and address weaknesses — of the Internet’s current host-based, point-to-point communication architecture in order to naturally accommodate emerging patterns of communication. By naming data instead of their locations, NDN transforms data into a first-class entity. The current Internet secures the data container. NDN secures the contents, a design choice that decouples trust in data from trust in hosts, enabling several radically scalable communication mechanisms such as automatic caching to optimize bandwidth. The project studies the technical challenges that must be addressed to validate NDN as a future Internet architecture: routing scalability, fast forwarding, trust models, network security, content protection and privacy, and fundamental communication theory. The project uses end-to-end testbed deployments, simulation, and theoretical analysis to evaluate the proposed architecture, and is developing specifications and prototype implementations of NDN protocols and applications. NDN Technical Report NDN-0001 “<a href=\"http://named-data.net/techreport/TR001ndn-proj.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Named Data Networking (NDN) Project</a>” is a slightly modified version of the NDN project proposal.</p>\n<p>The NDN project was funded by NSF in September 2010 as one of the four projects under NSF’s <a href=\"http://www.nets-fia.net/\" target=\"_blank\">Future Internet Architecture Program</a>.</p>\n",

Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease.</p>\n<p>The NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as <a href=\"http://cytoscape.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Cytoscape</a>, <a href=\"http://wikipathways.org/\" target=\"_blank\">WikiPathways</a>, <a href=\"http://sbml.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SBML</a>, and <a href=\"http://cbioportal.org/\" target=\"_blank\">cBioPortal</a>. <em>This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing!</em> For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over <strong>18,000 times per month</strong> by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab\" target=\"_blank\">&gt;90% success rate</a> with former students and projects. But don't take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab\" target=\"_blank\">students</a> and <a href=\"http://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab\" target=\"_blank\">mentors</a>.</p>\n<p>Find out more about the software projects being developed in coordination with NRNB.

This enables LibRoadrunner to simulate models on par with compiled C/C++ code. By combining Libroadrunner with standard optimization algorithms it is possible to use Libroadrunner to fit models to data. At present this is done by writing code to link the standard Python optimizer available via scipy with Libroadrunner. Although this works, it is inefficient and for large models, it is not practical. In this project, we would like to develop a C/C++ based differential evolution plugin that can be used directly by Libroadrunner (after integrating it with RRPlugins) without having to go via Python. This would enable us to provide high performance optimization capabilities.</p>\n",

Upon completion of this project developers will be able to complete all the above noted sub tasks by just interacting with the Gradle script. Also interacting with gradle script does NOT mean writing complex scripts but in fact will just include using of simple gradle command developed through this project.

The goal of this project is to bring this functionality to Neovim.</p>\n<p>The aim of the project can be summarized as: Whenever the user starts Nvim as</p>\n<p><code>nvim --connect {addr}</code></p>\n<p>the Nvim will connect to the Nvim server running at <code>{addr}</code>, where <code>{addr}</code> is either a <code>pipe</code> or a <code>tcp</code> address.

However, in many cases, screen reading software costs more than the computer itself. In the past, this has left computers inaccessible to millions of blind people around the world. This is a critical problem, because without computers, access to education and employment is severely limited, not to mention everyday tasks such as online banking, shopping and accessing the news.</p>\n<p>In April 2006, two blind programmers, Michael Curran and James Teh, began to develop a free screen reader called NVDA (NonVisual Desktop Access) for use with computers running Microsoft Windows. They then founded the not-for-profit organisation NV Access to support the development of the NVDA screen reader.</p>\n<p>NVDA has been translated by volunteers into more than 50 languages, and used by people in more than 120 countries. It has also won multiple awards.</p>\n<p>NVDA allows blind and vision impaired people to access and interact with the Windows operating system and many third party applications.\nMajor highlights include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Support for popular applications including web browsers such as Mozilla Firefox and Google Chrome, email clients, internet chat software, music players, and office programs such as Microsoft Word and Excel</li>\n<li>A built-in speech synthesizer supporting over 50 languages, plus support for many other 3rd party voices</li>\n<li>Reporting of textual formatting where available such as font name and size, style and spelling errors</li>\n<li>Support for many refreshable braille displays, including input of Braille via braille displays that have a braille keyboard</li>\n<li>Ability to run entirely from a USB flash drive or other portable media without the need for installation</li>\n<li>Easy to use talking installer</li>\n<li>Support for modern Windows Operating Systems including both 32 and 64 bit variants</li>\n<li>Ability to run at Windows logon and other secure screens</li>\n</ul>\n",

With this new feature, NDCube will become better placed to serve a wider array of n-dimensional data analysis needs from multiple astronomical communities.</p>\n",

A workaround used today  is holding variation data in VCF files that don’t update the reference meaning the reference will always represent the genome as it <strong>was</strong> not as it <strong>is</strong> or as it’s <strong>evolving</strong>. It’s clear that the current method of representing genomes is not ideal.\nThere is a need for a representing the reference in a data structure that contains its inherent variation. Different methods have been tried and the variant graph is a promising one. The way the graph works is by representing the variation within the genome as alternative paths one can traverse the graph through and conserved regions as nodes without alternative paths to the get to the next node; we then index the nodes for querying and alignment.\nMoreover, variation graphs hold an advantage with rapidly evolving genomes and short read data that could get thrown out when it doesn’t have a place to align to in the reference; with the variant graph short reads should reads could align to alternative nodes.</p>\n",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.</p>\n<h3>The Lab</h3>\n<p>The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to program robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://lab.open-roberta.org/</a> is online and has had more than 225 000 visits in 2018 across more than 100 countries.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 10 different robot plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EV3 LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>NXT LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>BBC micro:bit</li>\n<li>Calliope mini</li>\n<li>Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based</li>\n<li>NAO, a humanoide robot</li>\n<li>Bob3</li>\n<li>Nepo4Arduino</li>\n<li>mBot</li>\n<li>SenseBox</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Outlook</h3>\n<p>While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.</p>\n",

As for the Java programming itself there are countless software and editors which can make the work of a Java programmer easier. On the other hand there aren't any similar software which can be useful to a UML disigner since almost each drawing editor for designing UML diagrams is difficult to handle and requires to manupulate lines and shapes by hand. For that reason UMLGraphs is an important and useful tool not only for the UML designer but also for the Java programmer and fully functional software to automatically generate via coding commands class diagrams and sequence diagrams. UMLGraphs has been developed using com.sun.javadoc  API and now the next level to achieve is to make it be fully functional using the latest jdk.javadoc.doclet doclet API , which is the main goal of this project along with the support for Java features such as Lambdas and Generics, unit tests and integration tests.</p>\n",

As a result, it is difficult to obtain a unified result, with all the desired features and many people, who lack a computer science background, are excluded from using them.\nThe goal of the project is to build an online web GUI, that provides its users with an easy way to extract quantitive text profiles from multilingual texts. The text analysis will come from scripts that combine many existing NLP packages, written in many programming languages, like R's udpipe or Python's spaCy. The tool is going to be modular and open source, in order to be easily accessible and adaptable to everyone's needs. The project is going to boost and facilitate scientific research in NLP fields, as it will make text analysis available to people with little to none computer science knowledge (e.g. linguistics students).</p>\n",

However OpenCV's model zoo needs some new additions. Models that have acquired State-of-the-art (SOTA) in different computer vision tasks are somewhat lacking in the model family that is currently listed in the OpenCV repository. This gives rise to the necessity of adding new, powerful models to the list. The goal of this project is to curate more models for ease of use by the OpenCV DNN module and put them in a place where they can be easily accessed such as LFS on Git.  The proposed project will add six (potentially nine) new models to the OpenCV Model Zoo. \nAll of the selected models have, either state-of-the-art results in the task they perform or belong to a task category not currently present in the model zoo (e.g. Image Generation). The proposed workflow and the established timeline take into account worst-case scenarios, guaranteeing the project's completion and minimizing risks.</p>\n",

Using deep learning models for super resolution is a widely researched area, as they generally achieve better accuracy than classical computer vision based algorithms. There are many popular type of models used, ranging from supervised learning to unsupervised learning methods. I propose to implement two deep learning based models to be a part of the OpenCV library. One is EDSR, which is a residual network based model, and is known for it’s high accuracy. The other one is LapSRN, which is a fast, but still accurate model, that can be deployed to real-time applications. So integrating these two OpenCV would obtain a model that achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, and another one that can be deployed on devices that have lower computational power, while still maintaining high accuracy.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

The Wikidata project contains structured data about items, and statements about the relationships between items. In recent years, OpenStreetMap has gained a large number of Wikidata tags, and the information from the Wikidata database should improve the importance rankings and search results from Nominatim. To accomplish this objective, it will be necessary to create a script that can process a Wikidata dump and extract the information that would be useful to Nominatim, then import the data it into the Nominatim database. Nominatim already uses Wikipedia links to improve search results, and where Wikidata is available it can help determine the correct Wikipedia link that should be used whenever a Wikipedia link does not exist for an OSM object. This can be done both by directly matching objects to their Wikipedia links via Wikidata, and also by ensuring that links are made to the correct type of object and that links are not made to vague pages such as those that describe brands or other information that is not relevant to search result ranking.</p>\n",

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.\nFrom the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/en\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to <em>WiFi Metropolitano</em>: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.</p>\n<p> The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller\" target=\"_blank\">wifi controller</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>Why Oppia?</h3>\n<p>Oppia’s aim is to provide personalized tutoring to every single person in the world, especially those whose educational needs are not currently being served well. The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor.</p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven lesson creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Oppia offers tools for creating new explorations with the goal of allowing anyone to teach just about anything. Creating explorations is very much like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative lesson creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

The reason these two projects are linked is because one prerequisite for a safe migration is to have full test coverage, so it's important to make sure that the backend coverage is 100% before migrating.The project would  then make sure that all libraries Oppia uses are compatible with python 3. This project would also standardize all scripts in the codebase to be written in Python (currently, there is a mixture of bash and Python being used). The project would end with creating a small list of remaining steps that need to be taken for a final migration to python 3 (once a solution is found for the GAE dependency issues).</p>\n",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual application that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters. Lastly, we're moving to use software containers to make PEcAn even more light weight and easy to use as well as implementing an API to turn PEcAn into a SaaS product.</p>\n",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by longstanding contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. Not only that, but GStreamer is cross-platform, and is also used on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can easily use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies are. Thus you can easily create a working and stable dev env in no time.</p>\n",

We’re looking forward to our members in Africa and Asia! We use a variety of means to communicate, including a Google Group for announcements and a forum for discussions.</p>\n<p>PANOPTES occupies a unique niche in the ongoing search for exoplanets. Previous missions, such as Kepler, have focused primarily on one region of the sky, taking deep images in order to discover transiting exoplanets around mostly distant stars, leading to limited opportunities for imaging follow up as the majority of the targets are far away and dim. Current projects aim to fill this gap by targeting relatively bright and near stars, but continue to utilize expensive equipment and optimal site locations in order to ensure success, thus limiting the ability of the project to grow and adapt.</p>\n<p>PANOPTES is attractive because it can complement these missions, doing so cheaply and with the involvement of citizen scientists. And while the primary scientific interest of the PANOPTES project is to aid in the discovery of exoplanets via the transit-detection technique, PANOPTES is also a platform. We encourage other groups to come up with projects which use PANOPTES data, hardware or software to address other scientific questions, such as supernovae, near-earth objects (NEO), space debris, and more. It is the hope of the project that schools will come up with novel ways to utilize the unit and the data it gathers.</p>\n",

Specifically, the software addresses the problem of doing this efficiently and reliably on general purpose operating systems like OSX, Windows, Debian, etc.-- i.e., systems designed mainly for multi-tasking.</p>\n<p>Purr Data builds on code from several other software projects: Pure Data-- which is the audio and scripting engine, Pd-extended-- which is a now abandoned application that shipped Pure Data with lots of external libraries, and Pd-l2ork-- which added long-needed usability enhancements like infinite-undo and native state-saving mechanisms to Pure Data.</p>\n<p>Purr Data uses a GUI based on the nw.js toolkit.

Ideally, users of LiberTEM can benefit from implementation of these algorithms that they can run through a simple pipeline called User-defined functions, which allow the users to run functions with their desired functionality without having to worry about parallelization, which is done under the hood by LiberTEM. Therefore, my project will be concerning both the distributed implementation of a dimensionality reduction method as well as improving on the User-defined functions framework.</p>\n",

The GWR model in PySAL can currently estimate Gaussian, Poisson and Logistic models though the MGWR model is currently limited to only Gaussian models. This project aims to expand the MGWR model to nonlinear local spatial regression modeling techniques where the response outcomes may be discrete (following a Poisson distribution) or binary (Logistic models). Subsequently, to support efficient testing for different model implementations, a simulated data generator module will be implemented to supply test datasets following unique model variable distribution needs. This will also provide a foundation for possible expansion to test other local model implementations in PySAL. Additionally, since the functionality to predict the dependent variable at unsampled locations is not supported for the MGWR model in PySAL, this project also aims to enable predictions for MGWR.</p>\n",

Deconstructions of time that respect the linear progression of time like days, weeks and months are defined as linear time granularities and those that accommodate for periodicities in time like hour of the day or day of the month are defined as circular granularities or calendar categorisations. Often visualising data across these circular granularities are a way to go when we want to explore periodicities, pattern or anomalies in the data. Also, because of the large volume of data in recent days, using probability distributions for display is a potentially useful approach.The project will provide these techniques into the tidy workflow, so that probability distributions can be examined in the range of graphics available in the ggplot2 package.</p>\n",

Moreover, tCNN uses the different convolutional layer to capture different taxonomic rank (e.g. species, genus, family, etc).

This process, when done properly, takes a large portion of a researcher’s time when it would be better spent on doing the actual analysis. By developing a package that automates much of the data import, cleaning, filtering and standardization process, a substantial fraction of the researcher’s time will be saved, while automating a significant portion of the data gathering and management aspect of asset pricing research. We expect this last aspect to support the reproducibility of research by academics and financial professionals. Our over-arching goal is to make the EAPR package an ideal support tool for the wide range of asset pricing research as described in Ball, Engle, and Murray (2016), and for quantitative portfolio construction research. The initial version of the package will work very effectively with asset prices, returns and factors (exposures) data delivered by Wharton Research Data Services, a major source of empirical data for academic asset pricing researchers.</p>\n",

First, there is a need to implement some more random walks so we can choose which to use with respect to our problem, e.g. ratio of dimensions / constraints. Such a choice is important, because the sampling is the bottleneck of the proposed algorithms, so it must be as efficient as possible. Second, use these sampling methods to solve convex optimization problems and the redundancy problem. I propose a variety of randomized algorithms, such as one that uses cutting planes and one that uses simulated annealing. In the end, I will provide support for linear programming, semidefinite programming and mixed integer linear programming. A good part of the project will be testing to provide empirical data, since some of these algorithms perform better in practice than predicted by theory.</p>\n",

The package volesti is a c++ software with an R interface being the first package providing such a variety of options in geometric statistics. It currently scales to a few hundreds dimensions and hence it could be an essential tool for a quite large number of scientific applications. However, the possibility to scale from a few hundred to a few thousand dimensions was considered as a very far-reaching goal for many years. The goal of this project is to provide the first ever implementations for sampling from convex polytopes and volume computation in a few thousand dimensions. We exploit some very recent theoretical results that guarantee fast convergence and numerical stability in order to propose an efficient implementation of the current state-of-the-art geometrical random walk algorithms. The proposed implementations will be a decisive contribution to other scientific fields as computational geometry, finance and optimization. We hope this project will help educational programs, research or business communities.</p>\n<p>See <a href=\"https://tolischal.github.io/GSoC2019/\" target=\"_blank\">https://tolischal.github.io/GSoC2019/</a></p>\n",

Physiological data suggests that Grinnellian niches are convex in nature and they may probably have an ellipsoidal form when multiple dimensions are considered.

Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2019, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

The second objective is to expand the lexical units, frames and frame-to-frame relations in FrameNet 1.7 through a knowledge-driven approach and a distributional semantics approach. The knowledge-driven approach uses BabelNet to induce the frames of unrecognized lexical units in the tagged NewsScape dataset. The latter distributional semantics approach uses Deep Structured Semantic Models (DSSM) to create word embeddings of lexical units (LUs) to resolve the inconsistency in FrameNet hierarchy, tag LUs with their missing frames, and locate new frames using SemCor corpus. If time permits, DSSM is used to expand the frame-to-frame relations with Entity and Event frames using ACE 2005 Entities and Events dataset.</p>\n",

With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>\n",

For this, it is necessary to store the graph structure used to represent the knowledge of the world that the robot possesses. In RoboComp, when robots need to perform complex tasks, its behaviour is based on missions. The mission begin from an initial state and through different transitions reaches a final state, that is, the robot completes the mission. The states are represented by a graph. \nMy proposal is to use a JSON structure to store this graph. This allows its storage as a collection of documents in MongoDB. Consequently, each document could represent a state of the robot. Also, this slot is intended to study the viability of Neo4J for this purpose, as far as I am concerned, the best option would be to use the polyglot persistence, that consists in to use the database best suited for the type of data, in our case MongoDB, and in to use the database best suited for the type of queries, in our case Neo4j. Specifically I think that Neo4j Doc Manager could be our best choice.</p>\n",

The test infrastructure will be designed in a way that it will tell the developer what method or function or Which piece of code is causing the error or tests to fail. So It will be easy to find which portion of code is causing an error and the developer can fix that.\nProper test automation consists of the generation of test coverage reports as it helps in\nidentifying the areas of missing test coverage.

The project is mainly focused on adding the Framebuffer driver, this will enable the users to attach a display with their BBB project that uses RTEMS. The end product of the project will be a graphic console. Once the framebuffer driver is working and a console can be accessed through the HDMI display, it will open the way for further addition of graphics libraries, like the mouse support.</p>\n",

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.</p>\n<p>The mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.</p>\n<p>Python is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is also Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.</p>\n<p>Almost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Since 2014, ScummVM acts as a GSoC umbrella for game preservation projects, such as its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. The project started in 2001 and we recently widened our scope to RPG engines.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

Even when users are interested in a handful of syscalls, strace will intercept all syscall made by the observed processes, involving several context switches per syscall.</p>\n<p>Since Linux 3.5, userspace applications can rely on seccomp-bpf to filter the syscalls they want to trace. In that case, the set of monitored syscalls is filtered in the kernel, using cBPF, before any context switch to userspace. strace could leverage seccomp-bpf to avoid tracing syscalls users don't want.\nThe tracing landscape of Linux also drastically evolved in recent years. In particular, user applications can rely on eBPF programs to filter and aggregate data of interest in the kernel, with low overhead.</p>\n<p>During this Google Summer of Code, I will finish and merge the works started to 1) rely on seccomp-bpf to filter syscalls in kernel space and 2) allow strace to use alternative backends. That second work will come with a tracepoint/BPF proof of concept to ensure strace supports diverse backends, beyond the usual ptrace model.</p>\n",

A big roadblock to wider adoption are the specific tools that need to be learned on a per-vendor basis and their proprietary licensing.</p>\n<p>By working to implement a <strong>vendor neutral</strong> and <strong>modular</strong> flow that is <strong>easy to integrate</strong> with various types of other tools, and more closely corresponds to a development experience known to the wider software development community ever since GCC was created, SymbiFlow is meant to drastically accelerate software-driven innovation in FPGA development.</p>\n<p>SymbiFlow is already enabling new tools, development platforms and communities that build around the end-to-end open flow that is already working for some platforms. But there is still a lot of work ahead!</p>\n<p>To achieve SymbiFlow's goal of a complete FOSS FPGA toolchain, a number of tools and projects are necessary to provide all the needed components of an end-to-end flow. Thus, SymbiFlow serves as an umbrella project for several activities, the central of which pertains to the creation of so-called <a href=\"https://github.com/SymbiFlow/symbiflow-arch-defs\" target=\"_blank\">FPGA \"architecture definitions\"</a>, i.e. documentation of how specific FPGAs work internally.</p>\n<p>Those definitions and serve as input to open source backend tools like nextpnr and Verilog to Routing, and frontend tools like Yosys.

SymPy already has the features of generating source code for other languages from SymPy syntax. This would allow SymPy to easily read in, alter, and write out computational code. Sympy can easily be implemented in other programs as a computing engine because it's fast as compared to many other libraries and languages for computation. \nThe other objective of this project is to improve Lfortran and implement it as an interactive computational environment in Fortran and a library with an effective API in Python.

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

Thus, easy environments for reinforcement learning agents are those with dense reward signals. In these environments, most algorithms included in TF-Agents already achieve good results. However, in sparse-reward environments such as Montezuma’s Revenge from Atari 2600, such algorithms fail to discover optimal behavior as it rarely finds any nonzero reward. To mitigate this problem, multiple methods have been proposed to add intrinsic rewards or “curiosity” to existing algorithms to extend the capability of these algorithms.</p>\n<p>This project will implement three curiosity modules to TF-Agents: pseudocount-based exploration via Context Tree Switching (CTS), Intrinsic Curiosity Module (ICM), and Random Network Distillation (RND). These modules will be implemented as modules so that they can be enabled or disabled in one line for existing reinforcement learning algorithms in TF-Agents. With the addition of these modules, the users will be able to gain meaningful results without careful reward shaping on sparse-reward environments.</p>\n",

This main dashboard is known as OPS UI which is based on Apache wicket java web framework. Though it provides basic monitoring functionalities like retrieval of product status, metadata,workflow and platform health information etc. still it lacks of few important features like querying over products, product removal and workflow termination etc. Further the existing UI is not so user friendly and  prints stack traces when backend errors occurred. Moreover users have to deploy the complete OPS UI, even whether they are embedding components individually in their applications. The intention of this proposed project idea is to address all those loop holes  by implementing a new component based React UI with enhanced REST APIs. Moreover the implementation of the idea discussed here, is decided to be released with Apache OODT 2.0.</p>\n",

Transparency is a relatively easy concept to understand: the work that we do is done in a manner that can be observed by anybody with an interest. While many open source organizations regard openness as a synonym for transparency, the Eclipse community defines openness as a project team being open to new ideas, and inviting others to participate. Vendor neutrality ensures that no single vendor can dominate a project and that everybody plays by the same set of rules (a so-called \"level playing field\").</p>\n<p>Naturally, Eclipse projects are also all about the code. With over 350 <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/\" target=\"_blank\">open source projects</a> covering a diverse set of of technologies, there's something here for everybody.</p>\n<p>Eclipse projects build technology in areas such as <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/internet-things\" target=\"_blank\">Internet of Things</a>, <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/language\" target=\"_blank\">Programming Languages and IDE</a>, and <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/technology-type/runtime\" target=\"_blank\">Runtimes</a> and <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/ee4j\" target=\"_blank\">Jakarta EE</a>.</p>\n<p>For those students interested in research, we have an entire working group focused on <a href=\"https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/science\" target=\"_blank\">Science</a> where researchers from some of the world's most prestigious labs do open source development to support their research areas.</p>\n<p>You've probably heard about our market-leading software development tools; we have that, and so much more...</p>\n",

With over 45 international chapters, 350 members and 30 open source research projects around around the world, we are a mature, highly diverse and international organization.</p>\n<p>Simply put, our goal is to make a difference. We accomplish this via:</p>\n<p>Awareness - We raise awareness of the threats and vulnerabilities that exist in the Internet today. Many individuals &amp; organizations do not realize they are a target, nor understand who is attacking them, how, or why. We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats. This is provided through our Know Your Enemy series of papers.</p>\n<p>Tools - For organizations interested in continuing their own research about cyber threats, we provide the tools and techniques we have developed. All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional intelligence, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Labs. of America, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

We will use data flow analysis as proposed in VFix to accurately localize buggy code fragments in program under repair. We then use S3 to semantically reason about the identified buggy code fragments via dynamic symbolic execution on test cases. However, simply relying on test cases may not be sufficient. We thus plan to further enhance the semantic reasoning in S3 with the ability to leverage user-provided annotations. After this step, we obtain a set of constraints that constitutes specifications of the program. We then propose a program synthesis technique that improve the template-based repair in VFix and syntax-guided synthesis in S3 to synthesize repairs.</p>\n",

To reduce the amount of human intervention in surveying for more accurate and quicker results, I have submitted a proposal in which I plan to make an Android application which will use Machine Learning, Computer Vision through the Google Cloud Vision API and Tensorflow library to perform image analysis and aid the surveying process. The app will render the relevant PPI using the Apache-Fineract SPM API. Further, images may be uploaded to the Cloud Vision Models or fed to the embedded Tensorflow models which are made available using Firebase ML Kit to obtain a report of various objects detected and inferences derived relevant to PPI questionnaire.</p>\n",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.29 in January 2019). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/about/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">About/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 220 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

The overall performance of this kind of networks are strongly influenced by the characteristics of the signal propagation through the wireless link, thereby, a proper modeling of the channel behavior is of primary importance to obtain reliable results from the simulations. This project aims to tackle this issue by proposing an extension of the spectrum module to model both frequency and spatial-dependent phenomena, and to account for the directional behavior of the signal propagation. This will be achieved by implementing the modeling framework described in 3GPP TR 38.901, which includes the statistical characterization of different propagation environments, supports the modeling of multi-antenna systems, and, thanks to its modularity, can be easily extended with new environments or other additional features. Even if it has been specifically designed for the simulation of cellular networks, it supports frequency bands between 0.5 and 100 GHz, thus can be used even for other wireless technologies.</p>\n",

We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers</p>\n<h4>Our Games</h4>\n<p><em>Terasology</em> is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p><em>Destination Sol</em> is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h4>Architecture</h4>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data. The goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design. This goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams. On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis. With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. Tools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.</p>\n",

Following the increasing use of\ncontainers, one of Tungsten Fabric's use case involves integrating its virtual networking stack with the Kubernetes framework to provide a range of multi-tenant networking features. A significant\nproblem with this use case is the lack of automation and documentation around installation and\nsetup of Tungsten Fabric. This project aims to simplify the process of launching Tungsten Fabric in\nKubernetes. To do so, we will documentation of the installation process along with a walk-through of some use cases.

      "description_html": "<p>UCSC Xena helps biologists, both with and without computation skills, to visualize and analyze cancer genomics datasets. Our web-based data browser enables cancer researchers around the world to discover trends and test their hypotheses. Unique in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to easily view both large public resources generated by consortium around the world AND their own data or data from a publication. We accomplish this using a decoupled server-client architecture, where data is distributed across both public and private servers while being securely combined and visualized in one web-based browser.</p>\n<p>While we are funded nationally by NCI, our users are international, with only ~40% of our traffic coming from the United States. We are committed to open-source software and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our static interval tree[<a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree\" target=\"_blank\">http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree</a>] and KM statistics[<a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier\" target=\"_blank\">http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier</a>]).</p>\n<p>Students we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger UCSC Genomics Institute[<a href=\"https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/</a>], whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease.</p>\n<p>We aim to ensure that our students gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and code to the project. We are committed to putting the code from students out to production and into the world where it is used by real cancer researchers. In addition, we are always looking for long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genomics, statistics, data visualization, or functional programing, let us know! No prior knowledge of cancer or biology required.</p>\n",

This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><em>Focused around Web Performance</em> webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.</p>\n<p><em>Built in JavaScript</em> webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.</p>\n<p><em>Used at Scale</em> webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.</p>\n<p><em>Community Owned</em> webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders. This means that every decision we make is for them, and them only. We are funded by these same people as they help us improve and double down on their investment in their most important tooling.</p>\n",

X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.</p>\n<p>Today, as a result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with applications, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.</p>\n<p>Come help us make the future more open!</p>\n",

Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">much more</a> -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 500 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its <a href=\"http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html\" target=\"_blank\">extensive developer documentation</a> (140,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h4>What is ZynAddSubFX?</h4>\n<p>ZynAddSubFX is a cross platform synthesizer which provides a wide range of functionality to go from a basic oscillator to a full virtual musical instrument. A quick overview of some features includes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Polyphonic with support for legato and mono playing modes</li>\n<li>Three synthesizer engines:<ul>\n<li>Additive Synthesis for classic synth sounds composed of a variety of voices with powerful modulation. This exposes modulators ranging from LFOs and envelopes to oscillator modulators for FM, PM, and AM.</li>\n<li>Subtractive Synthesis for creating variable bandwidth harmonics from filtered white noise</li>\n<li>PAD synthesis for creating beautiful pads and other instruments</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>Powerful waveform generator with up to 128 sine/non-sine harmonics</li>\n<li>A variety of filters including analogue modeled filters, formant filters, and state variable filters.</li>\n<li>Envelopes can have ADSR (or ASR, etc..) modes or can be free modes (with any shape)</li>\n<li>Effects for Reverb, Echo, Chorus/Flange, Phasing, Wave-shaping, Equalizing, Dynamic Filtering with flexible signal routing</li>\n<li>A custom Ruby based window toolkit for optimal embeddability and scriptability</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>What makes ZynAddSubFX different?</h4>\n<p>Compared to other audio synthesis applications ZynAddSubFX offers a large number of simple building blocks in a mostly fixed signal routing. Each component on it's own is easy to understand, but once all the components interact, then new sounds can emerge and interesting modulation possibilities open up. Overall there are millions of parameters which can be manipulated from the user interface or via the open sound control API. With the collection of building blocks provided to users a powerful sound design tool is provided along with an interesting variety of development challenges. The challenges range from workflow issues, to signal processing trade-offs, to user interface refinements, and more.</p>\n",
