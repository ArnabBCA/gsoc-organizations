Faroe is a configuration API currently featuring a JSON and a SQLite backend. It enables the injection and automatic configuration of settings of various types in classes, including a Spring BeanPostprocessor. It allows us to set properties for OGC services. \n\tThe problem statement thus asks to create a web frontend to create, read, update and delete (CRUD) the JSON settings with a REST API on top of faroe API. I will try to develop a user-friendly UI for the same and make sure CRUD operations are carried out properly through UI, making it extensible and customizable.

Most of these changes involve refactoring existing methods to take in the directories specified in the command line input, which are then used in generating a LicenseScanner object so that these new licenses are cached properly.",

The survey found that almost 84% of the industry uses open source software, particularly for animation and visual effects, but challenges including siloed development, managing multiple versions of OSS libraries (versionitis) and varying governance and licensing models need to be addressed in order to ensure a healthy open source community.\n\nThe ASWF hosts several of the foundational projects that are ubiquitously used in the production of visual effects and feature animation. The mission of the ASWF is to increase the quality and quantity of open source contributions by developing a governance model, legal framework and community infrastructure that lowers the barrier to entry for developing and using open source software.",

However, some of the new issues came across that need to be addressed such as the expiration of manifest v2, an empty Django backend page, and single-browser supportability. I plan on improving the UI so that it will become more innovative and user-friendly, injecting the button feature in the Google Scholar page for direct navigation to an author's profile page, integrating extension with typescript, adding cross-browser compatibility and new metrics indexes, transitioning chrome extension to manifest v3, and providing dark mode and an option to toggle between light and dark themes. I also plan to make the codebase more polished by replacing javascript dom functions with jQuery and creating a login/signup page for enrolling new users. Besides this, I will also be maintaining detailed documentation on CI/CD integration testing, gulp automation workflow, and various test cases for making it useful to the new developers.",

          "abstract_html": "The basic features in an Election DApp are user registration, election creation, voting and result calculation. To make our DApp more flexible and user friendly, we need to add more voting algorithms apart from General Voting Algorithm. The three important features that need to be implemented are 1) Open and Invite based elections. 2) Authentication and user KYC. 3) Multiple algorithms to conduct elections. To implement these features, I would first work on the algorithms which will be written in Solidity. The front-end part will use Reactjs. For KYC verification, I'll use IPFS to store the document and encrypt the file. The admins can decrypt the file when verifying. This process of encryption, decryption and verification can be handled using Solidity.  There is also an option to create open elections or invite-based. Invite-based elections can be done using EmailJS and SendGrid to send the election link to the email. Since these links can be shared, there will be a check to ensure that only the invited voter is voting. To increase user engagement, we will provide a domain `abc.voter` to get them identified as a voter for using our platform. This domain will also mint an NFT and the voter now has it. There are several other features that I would add such as \"Extend Election Dates\", \"Restrict Past Dates\", \"Logout functionality\", \"Profile Edit\", and \"Improve the UI\".",

First, choose an adequate system for scaling based on the purpose of a scaling, dealing with events with high input rate. Second, examine the dataflow reshaping mechanism on stream query DAG and evaluate it though some experiment, since it is often helpful for efficient scaling on serverless framework. Finally, elaborate scaling policy to reasonably determine when to scale up on a serverless framework. This process mainly focuses on input rate on the stream that can cause high latency spike toward the system.",

But in reality, production environment exceptional logs are not known in advance and users can't enumerate all possible exceptional logs. This task aims to add an algorithm that can identify outlier log(s) from the massive logs, and draw the users attention to see whether there is error in the system. Log acquisition, log analysis, feature extraction, and anomaly detection are the four aspects of this algorithm. To extract the relevant features in log events, the feature extraction technique divides the log data set into finite blocks using a window. A representative approach of supervised learning is used to execute the final anomaly detection process (SVM). The algorithm should be able to learn from bot the history logs and streaming logs, and adjust itself to increase the accuracy.",

Since ShenYu clusters are able to support a large volume of internet business, it is crucial to decouple the systems and data streams. The Kafka plugins as a high-throughput distributed messaging system will enable ShenYu to have excellent horizontal scalability, scaling to millions of messages per second. It enables the data stream to communicate with less than 10 ms latency, almost real-time message transmission. In this feature, the logging-Kafka plugin will be able to store ShenYu’s logs and take the ShenYu gateway log information, write it to Kafka and display it. The module could be activated as a “Shenyu-plugin”.",

For service invocation, add the meshEnable configuration in ConsumerConfig to enable the mesh mode and add the providerPort in ReferenceConfig to specify the provider's service port. Modify the SDK, read the providerBy and providerPort in the configuration to determine the address of sending RPC. In the mesh environment, providerBy should be the ServiceName of the Provider. In Mesh mode, Invoker should remove clusters.\n\n2. For health checks, Istio comes with probes that align the life cycle of Dubbo and even the entire application with the life cycle of Pod. An active health check provided by Envoy removes unhealthy instances immediately and then joins the service route when the instance is healthy again. However, the readinessProbe implementation provided by Dubbo does not apply to mesh. If the registry is not configured in mesh mode, Dubbo's readinessProbe returns false, which needs to be modified here.\n\n3.  For traffic governance, you can use retry configuration, routing, load balancing and other traffic governance functions to find the methods to interact with Envoy (for example, the number of retries can be achieved by configuring the header).",

The existing methods in Commons Numbers would be refactored as static functions for use as Lambdas with the new API. The JTransforms library will be integrated for supporting operations such as fast Fourier and Discrete Cosine transforms. Optionally, an implementation using Java 17 vector API would be provided for basic operations on complex vectors and matrices. Performance benchmarks comparing different implementations would be published. The deliverables will include complete Pull Requests meeting all Apache Commons Numbers project requirements",

          "abstract_html": "MathWorks Simulink is a graphical programming language that allows one to create nonlinear vehicle models, and perform control system design and development. Using Simulink code generation tools to add a custom attitude controller to the ArduPilot will allow the researcher to test their novel control algorithm in ArduPilot without spending too much time in manual coding which will further increase ArduPilot usage in academia. \n\nCurrently, ArduPilot does not have a short and concise way to implement and test custom controllers. This project’s main aim is to create a systematic and sustainable way to implement a custom controller into ArduPilot using Simulink code generation and set an example for other researchers on how to use ArduPilot as a control system development platform. \n\nI implemented a new controller in the ArduCopter and has a Simulink model of this controller, thus I will continue with this vehicle type. But the methods laid during this project should be transferable to the other vehicle types. There are multiple-step I identified to achieve this goal. Firstly, the ArduCopter attitude controller code structure needs to be changed to allow running custom controller concurrently and safely switching between two-controller. Second, a hook in ArduCopter for Simulink code generation to bind should be created. Third, human-readable source code from Simulink without any dependencies on the Matlab libraries should be generated. Fourth, prepare a Matlab script to automatically merge generated libraries into ArduCopter source code, and configure and build it. Last, prepare detailed documentation and video to show how to utilize this functionality.",

I will be writing a research paper on simpPRU quoting its need,implementation done and its preferable usage.This will make the overall language more robust and efficient, which will help beginners who are learning to use the PRU or experienced users prototyping something on the PRU.",

There are some building instructions, but those are incomplete or difficult to follow for a non-developer user.\n\nMy objective is to use Github Actions to provide LibreCAD3 with regular releases in Windows and Linux. The windows release will consist of a .exe on the Github releases page of the Repository, while the Linux one will be released on Canonical's Snap Store as a snap and Github releases page as an AppImage. These releases will be tested before they are uploaded to Github/Snap Store.\n\nIf you are interested in how I plan to execute this objective feel free to open the Pdf, where there is my personal information, the detailed implementation of this automatization of releases and more!\n\nI've done two drawings describing it overall, the first one is the user vision which is the one I've described here(https://imgur.com/a/XGOmMM6) and the other one is the implementation diagram (https://imgur.com/a/KMgPU9V). Those are also on the pdf if the links are broken.\n\nFeel free to contact me at c.bezerdik@gmail.com if you cannot access the Pdf for any reason since there is the Personal Information, Detailed Project information and the progress I've already made in it.\n\nIt's the proposal of the organization found in (https://github.com/opencax/GSoC/issues/59).\n\nPost-Acceptance Edit: You can check out everything at https://dokuwiki.librecad.org/doku.php/gsoc:gsoc2022",

          "abstract_html": "Industry Foundation Class (IFC) is the leading open data format for the built environment, based on the ISO 16739-1:2018 standard. It’s the foundation of the openBIM workflow. Today, IFC is most often used as a software-agnostic way of exchanging building information, but there is increasing interest in using the IFC schema as the native format for working with BIM data.\n\n\nBlender, with its mature modelling and rendering capabilities, has the potential to become a powerful BIM authoring tool. Open data and integrated python console already give many options for customising the data and meta data of any geometric object. The BlenderBIM plugin introduces the possibility to assign the properties of IFC classes to native blender geometry and export correctly structured IFC files through the use of the IfcOpenShell software library that already contains many useful functions to work with the IFC schema.\n\n\nThe goal of this project is to develop a plugin for the visual scripting language for Blender, Sverchok, that would enable creating IFC geometry and data through the visual programming nodes, allowing the users to create their own parametric workflows and incorporate IFC data directly into their design process.\n\n\nAn equivalent plugin for Sverchok, would allow an integrated parametric design and native IFC workflow to be completed fully inside the FOSS environment. It would also be a strong foundation for integrations with other Building Performance Simulations (BPS) tools. Integration and porting of the nodes to FreeCAD would also be possible.\n\n\nSome of the basic nodes are already coded under the IfcSverchok project. The work will involve testing the existing nodes and writing many more to support the full use case. Since the IFC schema is very large, and often difficult to grasp for new users, emphasis will be on integrating the concepts of IFC into a typical design process in a natural manner and communicating the relevant information comprehensively to the user.",

It provides support for enforcing authorization based on various access control models like ACL, RBAC, ABAC for Golang, Java, Node.js, PHP, Python, .NET (C#), Delphi and Rust.\n\nWhat Casbin does:\n\n- Enforce the policy in the classic {subject, object, action} form or a customized form as you defined, both allow and deny authorizations are supported.\n- Handle the storage of the access control model and its policy.\n- Manage the role-user mappings and role-role mappings (aka role hierarchy in RBAC). Support built-in superuser like root or administrator.\n- A superuser can do anything without explict permissions.\n- Multiple built-in operators to support the rule matching. For example, keyMatch can map a resource key /foo/bar to the pattern /foo*.\n\nWhat Casbin does NOT do:\n\n- Authentication (aka verify username and password when a user logs in) Manage the list of users or roles. I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities.\n- Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container. However, Casbin stores the user-role mapping for the RBAC scenario.\n\nFor more details, see: https://casbin.org/",

          "abstract_html": "Casbin-dashboard is the official web UI (admin portal) for Casbin models and policies. Casdoor is a centralized authentication / Single-Sign-On (SSO) platform.\nProblem: \n1. A more friendly policy management UI is needed for Casbin-dashboard. And it should be able to handle 10,000+ more rules. 2. Test management page needs to be developed for Casbin-dashboard. A test page to make example requests to Casbin and get responses, like Postman. 3. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. Of course authorization will be implemented in Casbin. 4. Casdoor needs to sign up with email without verification by configuring the application edit page. 5. Casdoor needs to support configurable captcha in user flows. It can support different implementations.\nSolution:\n1. We can use more powerful and high-quality UI libraries such as Ant Design to build more friendly web UI. And in order to handle 10,000+ more rules, we can use paging display and virtual list in frontend, and we can use paging query and database index in backend. 2. We can build a test management page, so that we can create and edit our unit test case through the web page. 3. We can build an authorization management page to realize the authorization of the dashboard. We can use Casbin models to control the presentation of every element on the page and control each request of the RESTful API. 4. We can add a rule to control whether the email verification is required.5. We can integrate the different services from cloud captcha providers like gCaptcha, hCaptcha. To save a lot of work, we just only need to integrate the wrapper code.\nDeliverables:\n1. Allow to sign up with Email without verification for Casdoor. - June 7; \n2. Support configurable captcha for Casdoor. - June 28; \n3. A more friendly policy management UI for Casbin-dashboard. - July 11; \n4. Test management page for Casbin-dashboard. - July 23; \n5. Authentication and authorization for the Casbin-dashboard itself. - Aug 11;",

We need to find a better way to manage the casbin in-memory data when data grows.\n\nFrom my point of view, our main goal is to reduce the cost of memory as well as keep good performance handling policies read and write requests.\n\nIn order to achieve those key goals, we can introduce an experimental tuple storage to get charge of storing those policies, turning the policies management strategy from memory-oriented to disk-oriented. We can even make a better abstraction of the storage layer so that we can use different engines (row, column) for the different workloads.\n\nIn general, we can take the following parts into consideration to achieve our goals.  \n    1.

It provides a unique user­-friendly and \"biology­-centric computational user interface\", with the goal of making genomic data more easily accessible to translational scientists, biologists, and clinicians. The interface was explicitly built and continues to evolve with careful usability studies involving multiple biological and clinical users, and an active and engaged user base.\n\nThe public instance of cBioPortal (https://cbioportal.org/) is now one of the most popular online resources for cancer genomics data and attracts more than 4,000 unique visitors (cancer researchers and clinicians) per day. The two papers documenting the cBioPortal Cerami et al. Cancer Discov. 2012 & Gao et al. Sci. Signal. 2013 have been cited more than 5,600 and 5,100 times, respectively, since their publication. There are more than 30 actively used cBioPortal instances in hospitals, universities, pharmaceutical companies, and other institutes all over the globe.\n\nWe are a group of software engineers, bioinformaticians, and cancer biologists building software solutions for precision medicine for cancer patients. Our overall goal is to build infrastructure to support clinical decisions for personalized cancer treatment by utilizing “big data” of cancer genomics and patient clinical profiles. Our multi-institutional team currently has more than 30 active members, primarily from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center,  the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, and The Hyve, a bioinformatics company from the Netherlands.",

If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow.\n\nWhile we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, our media file management.\n\nIn addition to continuously evolve our core tool, we have a growing number of new projects: support, AI, rclone, cloud, flutter, peer-to-peer and a few more that are starting to take shape.\n\nThe best part is - students have flexibility of choosing projects from a wide range of topics & technologies and even propose their own. We provide exceptional resources for students. Read more about the perks on our website.\n\nWe’re very excited to take part in GSoC for the 9th time. Most of our past students are still involved and are active in the community, which simply goes on to show how friendly and approachable is the environment.

The HEP Software Foundation (http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.\n\nCERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, https://home.cern) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.\n\nThe experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.\n\nThe open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!",

These scripts will then provide users an easy way to deploy their deep learning models in their physics software and analysis frameworks.\n\nThis project will focus on development of some missing deep learning operations which will allow to build more complex networks within TMVA. Specifically, we propose to implement the inference functionality of some ONNX operators in the code generation format. The student can choose to build this based on existing implementations in TMVA or other existing machine learning software tools or build their own from scratch. The expected result is a working implementation of modular operators classes that implement the operators as defined by the ONNX standards in the code generation format.

Specifically, the g-2 physics experiment at Fermilab seeks to uncover whether a yet undiscovered force influences how the spin of the muon behaves.To do this it measures the polarization of the muon to seek new physics over thousands of revolutions in its custom accelerator ring. To replicate this in Geant4, the toolkit must track muons for 5,000 turns with near-perfect energy conservation and no drift in particle momentum.This necessitates the use of symplectic integration schemes to maintain the level of accuracy and precision required in the calculation. \n                       \nHence this projects aims to implement the following symplectic methods in the toolkit:\n1.)

This project focused on the Optimization and Inference components of the project. Very limited work is done on the model in terms of Memory Footprint Reduction. This project was aimed at implementing different post training  Memory Footprint Reduction techniques by creating a pipeline using KubeFlow, consolidating all the insights from different experiments and use them to extend KubeFlow pipeline built for carrying out the experiments into a more generalized form which can be used on different ML models at CERN to output the best optimized model.\n\nI integrated different Onnx Runtime Execution Providers - MLAS (default CPU),  CUDA, TensorRT,  oneDNN and OpenVINO into the Geant4 Par04 inference module. I have implemented an end-to-end KubeFlow pipeline which contains CPU and CUDA optimization modules which leverage different quantization and graph optimization workflows and reduce memory footprint of models while maintaining similar performance.

This software, developed over the past decade by hundreds of physicists, is constantly evolving to optimize the algorithms for better physics performance and resource efficiency. \n\nGiven the size, diversity and dynamic nature of the development team, quality assurance of the software is a big challenge. Belle II Software has had several monitoring schemes implemented so far, along with a high-level validation tool. This tool runs on existing large datasets producing distribution plots of quantities relevant for physics analyses and displaying the results on a webpage. This project aims to improve this validation tool. Bookkeeping of known issues detected by the tool, along with improved logging and integration with the issue tracking system can help fast track root cause analyses. The plots generated can also display more relevant information, and point toward the datasets used to encourage the reuse of common artefacts. \n\nThe plan is to enhance the user experience of the Belle II software validation tool and make workflows more efficient with appropriate technical solutions. We will start with integrating the issue tracking system with the validation tool, to better track the history of degradations. The plotting module will be overhauled to include relevant software information, as well as hyperlinks to make them self-sufficient. Enhancements to the logging module to have better logs attached directly to the issues from the validation tool to fast track issue debugging. The common artefacts will be pooled together in a manner allowing for easy reference from plots, logs and issues and also to prevent regeneration overheads. All the changes will be integrated with the production code, after rigorous testing, along with detailed documentation.",

Examples of components include convex hulls, convex decomposition, Delaunay triangulations, Voronoi diagrams, polygonal surface mesh data-structures, mesh generation, Boolean operations, envelope computations, intersection detection, surface reconstruction, and subdivision surfaces.\n\nCGAL is used in a variety of application domains such as CAD/CAM (computer aided design and modeling), GIS (geographic information systems), geophysics, image processing, molecular biology, robotics, motion planning, and graphics.\n\nCGAL is written in C++ and rigorously adheres to the generic-programming paradigm.\n\nCGAL became an Open Source project in 2003. Most of CGAL is under the GPL v3+ license, and some core parts are under the LGPL v3+. The semi-annual releases have currently about 10,000 downloads.

      "description_html": "The importance of open source software is no longer in question and its importance raises important questions about how we understand the health of the open-source projects we rely on. Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts on the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects. In response, people want to know more about the open-source projects they are engaged with. For example:\n\n1. Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.\n\n2. Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.\n3. Open source companies want to know which communities to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.\n\nOpen source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.\nIn response to these issues, the CHAOSS project develops metrics, practices, and software for making open source project health more understandable. By building measures of open source project health, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.\n\nThe project goals are to:\n1. Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community health\n\n2. Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development\n\n3. Develop programs for the deployment of metrics not attainable through online trace data\n\nBuild reproducible project health reports",

Augur and Grimoirelab are two powerful open source community health analytics projects supporting the CHAOSS mission. In particular, each has implementation of select metrics based on an expanding set of implementation-agnostic metric definitions associated with various focus areas.\n\nThe CHAOSS Metrics Model Working group defines metric models, which integrate multiple CHAOSS metrics in a way that makes it easy for end users such as community managers to get a more comprehensive measure of an open source community. Currently, Conversion Rate can be defined as a metric or metric model. It measures the rates at which new contributors to an open source project move through the \"contributor funnel\" toward sustained contribution and/or community maintainership. There is no implementation of the Conversion Rate metric or metric model in CHAOSS software yet.\n\nThis project aims to build a novel implementation of Conversion Rate as a metric model that is based on a minimum number of atomic metrics and has maximum reuse of existing implemented metrics as well as common metric model calculation code supporting all types of conversion rates. A simple config file based UI for entering parameters and filters by the users is all it takes to run the metric model. \n\nNew metrics will be implemented first in Jupyter Notebook as reference code and can later migrate into Grimoirelab backend (for sharing with future new metric models or reports) along with data collection and enrichment extensions. The Metric Model calculation code and methods, and a common visualization interface will be also implemented in Jupyter Notebook, followed by a deployment with OpenSearch Dashboards visualization.",

It provides an efficient way to compute and visualise the metrics through an API. Using this API will provide a more accessible way to understand and visualise various metrics.\nDeliverables:\n1. Create an API for visualising the metrics provided by various machine learning workers and improve their performance.\n2.

          "abstract_html": "OpenFASOC is an open-source framework for autonomous generation of optimized integrated circuit blocks given user specifications. It is a growing project divided into multiple circuit block generators, one of which is a novel temperature sensor design. While the generated temperature sensor circuit is adequate, its resulting physical layout is not. A multi-voltage domain structure causes issues with routing between circuit components, which needs to be reworked. To do so, the OpenROAD tool will be studied to implement a better generated layout by tweaking the OpenFASOC flow. An opening to a design space exploration (DSE) optimization technique for the flow parameters is also proposed.\n\nDeliverables: an updated, working generator flow that outputs OpenFASOC's temperature sensor physical layout (GDS and DEF files) in SkyWater 130nm with no LVS, DRC or simulation errors.",

This proposal includes the detailed CI flow which can check the functionality and performance of the designs generated.

While LLD is regarded as a faster alternative to system linkers, the new mold linker has shown that there are still speed gains to be had. My work will include bringing parallelism to the construction of various linker-synthesized sections in the Mach-O port, and to input file reading. Regarding diagnostics, I’m going to implement deduplication for “undefined symbol” errors in the Mach-O port and utilize debug information to show where duplicate symbols are defined.

The interface is exposed under the window.performance object and allows web developers to accurately determine and diagnose slowdowns, bottlenecks etc in their web applications.\n\nTo ensure all developers encounter consistent behaviors and implementations of the Performance API across different web browsers,  the web-platform-test project has a suite of tests that can be used to determine the browser's compliance with the current specification. These include tests for ResourceTiming, NavigationTiming, PaintTiming, ServerTiming, EventTiming portions of the API, and tests related to reporting the Performance entries and dealing with various methods of preloading resources.\n\n\nIn this project, I will be working with mentors to bring Chromium’s implementation of the Performance API more in line with the implementation specified in the web standards. This will be done by analyzing, debugging and fixing failures reported by the web-platform-tests project. By the end of the project, I would want to achieve a 100% pass on all tests in the web-platform-tests suite and be able to address and provide fixes for tests that fail intermittently, as reported on the flake portal.",

This requires the use of web components for client-side rendering and state management. All the current HTML templates would be converted into the Lit components and managed by a new top-level component, which would also have a router to manage the routing of the whole app. In addition, parts of the server code that return HTML elements upon API requests would have to be redesigned.

          "abstract_html": "WebAssembly has become extremely popular among the developer community lately. It offers near native performance in a browser and is meant to not be a hand written language but to be the compilation target of source languages like C, C++, Rust etc. It provides a way to run code written in multiple languages on the web at near-native speed, with client apps running on the web that previously couldn't have done so. It, being a new language , does not enjoy wide support across platforms. The prospect of having a unified interface for web developers has long been elusive. It has the potential to provide the basis on which many apps can be built and deployed for a huge range of devices from IoT devices to fully fledged servers. But to enable developers to use it we need a WASI runtime ecosystem to support them. WasmEdge is one such project that aims to bring WebAssembly to the edge.\n\nTo provide  a unified  interface accross multiple platforms, a interface between WasmEdge and the host operating system has to be built. This interface is specific to the platform on which the runtime is deployed and has to be built individually and specifically for each platform bearing in mind the features available. The native API provided by the OS should be used to implement many of the common operations like file manipulation, IO etc. These 'host functions' are crucial for the project to succeed and have been defined in WASI - the Web Assembly System Interface which is a modular collection of standardised APIs\n\nCurrently, host specific functions have not been implemented in WasmEdge, for the windows platform. These functions are supposed to be implemented using the Win32 API and have to go rigorous testing before being deployed.",

          "abstract_html": "Running Kubernetes should be done with the utmost security in mind. KubeArmor provides a policy based system to increase the quality of security in a Kubernetes cluster. Users need to define their own policy when implementing KubeArmor. Most users might find it challenging to define the most appropriate and effective security policy based on their use case. Currently there are limited ways for users to actually get observability data that can be used to assist them and provide better reasoning when creating an optimal security policy. The solution to this problem is by providing visibility telemetry events to show pod or container observability data. Observability data can consist of processes executions, file system accesses, and network accesses. This information is expected to assist users to create an optimal security policy. This solution is implemented by developing and deploying a Kubernetes service that will connect to the KubeArmor relay and get the events from the daemonsets. These events will then be aggregated and stored in the database for future use. Users can get the data by using the KubeArmor CLI program which will be extended to accommodate this solution.",

There are millions of devices running coreboot, including Google Chromebooks and Chromeboxes, and it runs in many datacenters. In 2021, coreboot.org had over 300 active developers, and over 6000 commits.\nThe coreboot project believes in the principles of Open Source software. It borrows many well known concepts from other Open Source projects: Kconfig, Linux kernel coding style, git repository, and Gerrit for code reviews.\ncoreboot has numerous advantages over other firmware projects. It comes with SoC support available to all developers. The codebase is shared with developers and companies which are helping to improve the SoC and driver-specific implementations.\n\n** Extremely fast **\n- coreboot is designed to do the minimum amount necessary and get out of the way.\n- Desktop and Notebooks boot up in 400ms - 2.5s.\n- Server boot time can be as low as a quarter of the OEM BIOS boot time.\n\n\n** Flexible and customizable **\n- Because coreboot only does hardware init, then jumps to a payload to continue, it is very flexible.\n- GPLv2 licensed core. Payloads can be proprietary and we offer a BSD licensed support library. coreboot provides ready-to-build payloads like UEFI, SeaBIOS, U-Boot, Grub2 and many more.\n- Recovery Mode based on multiple copies of the firmware which can be updated independently.\n- Integrity of stages and binaries in coreboot can be easily verified.\n- Designed for security by default.\n- Uses a minimal trusted computing base for each platform which is easily auditable, helping to guarantee security. As coreboot is Open Source, anyone can check the codebase.\n\n** Debugging **\n- There are multiple ways to extract the boot log, from classic serial to EHCI debug, even over the pc-speaker.\n- GDB Stub support via serial.\n- In memory console log support.\n- Tracing functions and other exotic features are supported.",

Adapt the old reference system to the new one.\r\n\r\n2. Clean the current bibliography data, and identify the different types of entities that may be extracted.\r\n\r\n3. Generalize the entity reference system from bibliography: given a citation entry, the user should be able to navigate to the various types of entities using the links in the citation entry. This would conform to cakePHP conventions so that connections are bidirectional: in the entity page, the user should also be able to view which citation entries refer to this single entity.\r\n\r\n4.

The data is stored in a specific format and can be queried using the SPARQL language hence it becomes difficult for lay users that are not familiar with formal query language such as SPARQL to search their interests. Question Answering (QA) systems have worked very well to solve this problem. The Neural QA model focus on seq2seq learning to translate natural language questions to their respective SPARQL queries. The goal of the project is to make our end-to-end system perform better via the automatic generation of natural language question (NLQ) templates, the inclusion of new varieties of questions that have advanced SPARQL queries, improving the compositionality of questions, and enhancing the existing generator and learner module.",

Although text as an input is an efficient approach to query the graph, there are cases where we do not know what we are seeing. How does one  search the knowledge graph (KG) in such cases? Imagine being able to query the DBpedia Knowledge Graph (DB-KG) using images! \n\nThe idea here is to create a framework that can combine existing computer vision techniques with knowledge graphs. Doing this will enable us to query the existing knowledge graphs using multiple modalities: images and text. To this end, in this proposal, we examine and explore two aspects of DB-KG:\n(a) A framework to create an image-based KG out of existing DBpedia entries;\n(b) Using the graph created to perform tasks like image querying, text + image search, and using relevant input images to add more images to existing articles.",

      "description_html": "Biomedical Informatics is a multidisciplinary field that is motivated by our desire to improve diagnosis, clinical care, and human health, through novel computational approaches to use (and learn from) biomedical and clinical data. We use our expertise in computer science and informatics by developing various enabling tools, technologies, and algorithms to solve specific biomedical and clinical applications. And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC contributors have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (>1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data. Many of these projects have been published in reputable journals and presented at major conferences. Some of the projects proved to be so successful that they were adopted in major national/international biomedical research initiatives.",

Niffler acquires images from the PACS in real-time (meta-extraction) and on-demand (cold-extraction), then extracts DICOM metadata into a Mongo database or a CSV file, and performs computations on the metadata to compute utilization metrics for the scanners. This project performs the computations for the MR scanners, although it can be used for any modality. However, these computations were largely limited to the study level - how frequently a scanner idled between studies and how long it took for a scanner to perform a given study. Computing those metrics in a finger granularity, at the series level, is more challenging since the start time and end time of a series is harder to find with just public DICOM headers.\nFurthermore, while this project has a scanner utilization computed in the backend, there is no integrated front-end to present the results elegantly. The created results are currently stored in CSV files and displayed through an Eaglescope dashboard. The front-end can be improved with better integration.",

The two use cases which were used in the description were much interested. I was learning with the react over the past 10 months. So I would like to solve the problem in a good manner like combining the react with PHP or Python.  So, First of all, they asked us to build a menu section that should be globally active around the other pages. This can be done by the react components. Which I had the idea of doing it. In the second use case, they asked to create a menu(s) that changes from page to page like the \"Content Moderator Shortcuts\" menu to the \"moderator\" role. Which we can implement with React router dom. But the main task of this objective is to combine the react with drupal. While we know Drupal still serves as a backend repository, front-end frameworks can talk to the database via API calls. By making the  Make a stand-alone front-end and using drupal to create APIs which interact with the database. Then consume the API through HTTP AJAX or whatever mechanism React Js contains. Yeah, while coming to symphony it's been a task for me to learn it for using it as a framework. I have already had a little experience with the laravel framework. I am keen interested and fully fledge to be a part of this project.",

Simply reflash remotely via SSH.\n\n+ No instant reboot needed. Reflash your chip in a running system, verify it, be happy. The new firmware will be present next time you boot.\n\n+ Crossflashing and hotflashing is possible as long as the flash chips are electrically and logically compatible (same protocol). Great for recovery.\n\n+ Scriptability. Reflash a whole pool of identical machines at the same time from the command line. It is recommended to check Flashrom output and error codes.\n\n+ Speed. Flashrom is often much faster than most vendor flash tools.\n\n+ Portability. Supports DOS, Linux, FreeBSD (including Debian/kFreeBSD), NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, anything Solaris-like, Mac OS X, and other Unix-like OSes as well as GNU Hurd. Partial Windows support is available (no internal programmer support at the moment, hence no \"BIOS flashing\").",

          "abstract_html": "The write operation in flash can only change bits in a specific way and the erase operation changes all the bits of a block to 1s. So to modify any bit the whole block needs to be copied to another memory, erased on the flash, and then copied again from the other memory with the change. Due to this “erase overhead” write operations may require copying a lot of data to modify a small amount. Most flash chips support multiple erase-block sizes and flashrom keeps a list of these sizes and ranges for all supported flash chips. Currently, flashrom tries these functions one by one and uses the same function until the operation is completed or an error occurs. Usually, the first function works correctly but this function erases the smallest erase-block so flashrom would have to use it multiple times to complete the erase operation on a large region, which could have been done more efficiently using functions using larger erase-blocks, thus resulting in a transaction overhead. If a large erase-block size to erase a small region is chosen it would result in a larger erase overhead. So the erase-block size should be picked according to the size of the region left to be erased. Also checking in advance to tell if the programmer supports the given erase function and then sorting the supported functions in order of the erase-block sizes can further help the function selection.",

It also describes in detail my commitment to the program and my programming background as well.\n\nGoals of Projects :\n\n1. Made packages from different domains like Command-Line Parsing, General Purpose Libraries, Command Line Parsing, and much more compatible with Fortran Package Manager.\n2. Collaborate with maintainers of the packages which are to be made available on the fpm registry.\n3.

          "abstract_html": "Large digital designs are prone to consume lots of power and thus, a tool for power analysis is needed. There are two types of power analyses: static, which is more of an estimation that ignores circuit operations, and dynamic, which simulates the circuit behavior in conjunction with switching power. These tools are Verilog gate level-simulations and SPICE simulations, respectively, but the former can be inaccurate while the latter is computationally demanding. IRSIM, a tool intermediate between these two simulation tools, simulates the circuit as a network of transistor capable of turning ON and OFF, serving as a tradeoff between speed and accuracy in dynamic power analysis. The goal of this project is to develop and enhance a command-line interface compatible with up-to-date transistor components in the IRSIM library to ensure the analysis accounts for various power domains.",

Specifically, it has to translate two circuits into their fundamental boolean equations and formally prove or disprove their equivalence through the aid of an existing SMT solver (an engine for determining whether mathematical formulas are satisfiable).",

          "abstract_html": "Utilizing cloud FPGAs prove to be very expensive and minor coding bugs could consume precious compute cycles and incur hefty bills. This proves using FPGAs on AWS F1, virtually ineffective for students, enthusiasts and early researchers. Additionally, 1st CLaaS, already has a streaming interface in place, not all hardware accelerators would require continuous streaming of data. The addition of support for Memory Mapped Interfaces like AXI4, AXI4 Lite, Wishbone and custom interfaces similar to RoCC, Core-V eXtension interface etc., would enable a wider ecosystem of hardware accelerators to support 1st CLaaS integration without any RTL Level modifications. \n\nBesides these, supporting 1st CLaaS on Local FPGAs/Remote FPGAs contrary to AWS F1 would prove useful to enthusiasts, researchers, professors and students having FPGA on-premise or remotely accessible. 1st CLaaS for PYNQ leverages the PYNQ (Python Productivity for Zynq) Framework, which consists of a Jupyter Server running in a Linux Operating system on the ARM Processor in the Zynq SoC. Addressing the current limitations of 1st CLaaS, the proposed framework that not only brings 1st CLaaS to PYNQ FPGAs, but also vendor agnostically automates TL-Verilog/Verilog/SystemVerilog based Hardware accelerator design from RTL to bitstream and deployment eliminating the need to interact with a wide range of vendor specific tools. The framework would provide a complete FPGA based hardware design flow within the browser/terminal right from designing in makerchip-app and IP-Block design-Bitstream generation to deployment on FPGA in a single command.",

A notable example of such a rate control algorithm is Minstrel HT, the default for Linux-based OpenWRT access points. In Linux, the rate control is handled in the mac80211 kernel subsystem. As such, the development of rate control algorithms is restricted to the kernel space which includes Minstrel HT. This restriction has posed limitations and challenges in the research and development of rate control algorithms. To this end, this project aims to implement Minstrel HT in user space for OpenWRT access points.",

          "abstract_html": "Wireless communication and in particular WiFi networks are becoming more and more important. Research already focuses on improving reliability, performance of such networks and also efficiency of the underlying hardware. One promising candidate for improvements is TX-Power Control (TPC). Adjusting the transmit power per packet basically promises improvements in overall throughput in wireless networks and/or the efficiency by improved resource allocation in wireless networks.\nDated back to 2007, Atheros IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n chipsets driven by ath5k and ath9k Linux drivers did first and Mediatek joined recently with hardware support for tx-power control. Those also allow access to set the tx-power per packet, but yet do not provide a driver interface for this. Unfortunately, also the mac80211 subsystem, which is responsible for WiFi communication in the Linux kernel, does not provide an appropriate API to support TPC and per-packet annotation of tx-power.\n\nThe goal of this project is to implement the missing three-tier software parts: (1) mac80211 structs to annotate tx-power levels per packet, (2) mac80211 structs to account tx-power status information once transmitted and (3) a transmit power control (TPC) API for TPC algorithms. This is achieved by developing and implementing the required structs in the mac80211 subsystem, modifying  Linux WiFi drivers to make use of this API, and testing and validating the implementation in several experiments.",

Ensembl has grown into a champion of biodiversity, providing data for tens of thousands of species across our vertebrate, metazoa, plant, fungi and bacterial divisions.\n\n- MGnify (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metagenomics) provides a free to use platform for the assembly, analysis and archiving of microbiome data derived from sequencing microbial populations that are present in particular environments. Over the past 2 years, MGnify has more than doubled the number of publicly available analysed datasets held within the resource.\n\n- WormBase (https://wormbase.org/) is one of the World's oldest active bioinformatic resources, more than 20 years old. We scan all published literature and datasets on the model organism C. elegans, to create a very comprehensive resouce of genomics, strains, experiments, paper and people, aimed towards accelerating research and discoveries in fundamental biology as well as human health.\n\n- The Hugo Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) and its sibling project the Vertebrate Gene Nomenclature Committee (VGNC) are jointly responsible for defining the official names of genes in human and key vertebrate species. This official nomenclature ensures that studies and results on the same gene can easily be aggregated. \n\nGiven the rapid pace of generation of genomics and sequencing data, we support a fast-evolving software stack, and are constantly investigating new solutions for data storage, processing, distribution and display.\n\nPlease visit our projects page for ideas on potential GSoC projects:\nhttps://www.ensembl.info/about/projects/",

But it has a few limitations. \n\nFirst, in order to fetch data from different Elasticsearch indices or to fetch details of different documents, user has to make multiple API request calls. \n\nSecond, users have to write CURL queries to work with the API which users may find complicated.\n\n\nProposed solution:\n\nThe main aim of creating a new backend for the Functional Annotation of Animal Genomes project (FAANG) is to make accessing and handling required data for users much easier than the current setup. In order to achieve this the following are the main tasks for the project:\n\nFirst, creating a Back End for Fetching Data (BE Read): To create a GraphQL Server which will make it easy to fetch the required data using advanced operations like join and aggregations by making a single API call to the Back End.\n\nSecond, creating a Front End for Fetching Data (FE Read): To create a UI for selecting which data is to be fetched.\n\nHence using a GraphQL Server, user only needs to make a single API call, and with a better UI, user wont have to worry about writing queries for fetching data.\n\n\nDeliverables : \n\n1. Basic Fetching of documents (single and multiple documents of an elasticsearch index)\n2. Implementing Dataloader in the GraphQL server for decreasing DB hits\n3. Implementing Filter and Join functionality between elasticsearch indices for fetching data from the GraphQL server\n4. Implementing Aggregation for data to be fetched from the GraphQL server\n5.

          "abstract_html": "A key challenge surrounding modern bioinformatics is to manage and store the growing amount of biological data with both space efficiency and scalability. Traditionally, biological data are often stored as human-readable flat files or as entries in a conventional relational database. However, a drawback of such approaches is that the space required to maintain these data is becoming increasingly unmanageable, significantly reducing the scalability. Additionally, along with the size of the database, the time to query the database also increases. As stated in the problem statement, on Ensembl, homology data are currently stored as tuples in a relational database, resulting in the whole database being large and hard to scale. A natural way to compactly store the data is to exploit the intrinsic hierarchical structure of homology relationships. We propose multiple hierarchical data structures and formatting methods to improve the space efficiency of homology databases as well as important metrics to consider when designing such data structures and formats. We propose these potential approaches with the application in actual gene homology databases in mind. As part of the project, we will implement the representations using Python and/or C++ and evaluate them using proposed metrics.",

But it has limitations that it can still not recognize many entities of predefined classes due to being trained on a dataset having less training data in natural language form and less generalized RegEx/string matching rules. Also, due to the poor entity normalization approach, many extracted entities are being ignored in the final output stage of the pipeline. \n\nThis project proposal aims to increase the entity detection capabilities of this “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system by firstly integrating additional RegEx/string matching rules in the current pipeline. Secondly, by combining other training datasets with the existing IDP4 dataset and then extending this combined training dataset using active learning to capture more data classes in natural language form. Lastly, re-training the current BioBERT model using a modified approach and making the entity standardization approach more general and scalable. Along with improving entity recognition of existing data classes, this proposal also aims to extend the current “Named Entity Recognition” (NER) system to extract data classes related to the CRISPR-cas9 experiment.",

The goal of Gentoo is to design tools and systems that allow a user to do that work as pleasantly and efficiently as possible, as they see fit. Our tools should be a joy to use, and should help the user to appreciate the richness of the Linux and free software community, and the flexibility of free software. This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.) If the tool forces the user to do things a particular way, then the tool is working against, rather than for, the user. We have all experienced situations where tools seem to be imposing their respective wills on us. This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.\n\nPut another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.\n\nThe goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great? Our mission is to give that sensation to as many people as possible.",

The current focus of GeomScale is on scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. Towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and python interfaces (the latter is hosted in package dingo), for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling. In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. To our knowledge it is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date. It is, in several cases, orders of magnitude faster compared to packages that solve the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g., the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration.",

However, there can be an exponential number of such orders. Hence the running time to count the number of total orders that preserves $P$ will be exponential.

Thus, sampling algorithms are essential in many scientific fields. Biology in general, and most particularly metabolic modeling, is among those scientific fields that need such approaches the most to address their modern challenges. Flux Balance Analysis (FBA) is a typical example of a constraint-based metabolic model (CBMM) [2]. However, flux sampling is considered a superior methodology. Python package dingo provides the Multiphase Monte Carlo Sampling (MMC) algorithm to sample from the flux space of a metabolic network. However, the preprocessing methods implemented in dingo need major improvements regarding memory allocation. The goal of this project is to improve the preprocessing methods in dingo to support faster sampling and rounding pipelines.",

The implemented sampler should return samples from log-concave distributions constrained in polytopes as well as spectrahedra.  First of all, the initial implementation will be based on very recent promising research about an RHMC algorithm constrained in polytopes. We will expand on this effort by extending its capabilities to handle Spectrahedra. Afterwards, the above implementation will be used as a subroutine for a Semidefinite Program (SDP) solver. Last but not least, we will also include benchmark tests to compare the efficiency of our code against other state of the art libraries.

This problem is technically difficult due to the constraints of correlation matrices (entries in [-1,1], positive semi-definiteness). The current methods can only scale to a few tens of dimensions.\n\nThis project aims to provide efficient C++ implementations for new geometric-flavored algorithms to sample correlation matrices (Arakelian, Chalkis 2021)  and integrate them into VolEsti, an open-source high-performance software for sampling, volume computing and geometric statistics. Our main tasks consist of implementing a new class of convex bodies to represent the space of correlation matrices and geometric operations for performing two random walk sampling algorithms (the accelerated billiard walk and Reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo algorithm) over those convex bodies. These tasks can be supported by the already existing geometric facilities of VolEsti and the theoretical results found in related works. We will focus mainly on building an optimized C++ code to achieve better scalability for those algorithms and carry out intensive experiment and benchmark with other competitors to justify our efficiency. \n\nThe expected duration of this project is 175 hours spread over 7 weeks of coding period (June 13 - July 29). The C++ implementation obtained by the end of this project will expand VolEsti towards an all-in-one high-performance statistic tools for research and business uses.",

These tools are constantly updated by either upgrading the underlying implementation or by applying configuration changes.\n\nThe problem is how do we know if these changes improve the tool? If we want to do it in a systematic and data-driven way we can use benchmarking, which allows to measure how impactful and useful the change or configuration update is.\n\nThe goal of this project is to build a benchmarking framework that would allow for frictionless assessment of the quality of the security analyzer before it reaches the production environment. This greatly benefits the SAST community, as the framework opens a way to make data-driven decisions in the development of SAST.",

Such an objective seems useful for: \nDiscovering the optimal format for performance critical applications.\nEasy conversion from one tool to another, for bioinformatics researchers and hackers.\n\nWe will achieve that by using an Internal Representation of the different possible semantic data represented in each format, that will then allow translation from one format to another. This IR will probably be built in one of the widely used standard file formats, such as Protocol Buffers or Amazon’s Ion, since these technologies are already being widely used and already have great performance and a lot of features built into them.",

These clusters can be in different geographical locations and be managed by different institutions.

There are also further regressions to be addressed caused by the GTK 4 port.\nMy proposal for this project is to design and implement a new UI for this feature that will mainly resolve the discoverability problem - when there are no templates in the Templates directory, the new document menu is not shown, and many users don’t know about its existence. Another thing I’ll focus on is the ability to easily add more templates, which could possibly require various changes across the ecosystem. I will be working in close cooperation with the Nautilus developers, GNOME design team, and with various user studies in mind. \nMy main goals are following:\n1. Design and implement an empty state in the New Documents menu, that will offer the user the ability to add new templates, both pre-defined as well as custom.\n2. Making use of visual representations of each template, such as icons, to help users find what they’re looking for.\n3. Add the ability to search the list of templates to add to the menu.",

Evaluation, mockups, code-complete implementation, testing, and documentation of the individual elements such as labels, links, and images as well as composite components such as headers, footers and pagination will be performed.\n\nThe project ensures creating a consistent framework with an exhaustive three-step workflow:\n1. Inventory/Evaluation Phase: Variations in individual elements and composite components from each website are recorded to ensure all alternates are captured.\n\n2. Iterative Design Phase: Mockups are created for each evaluated component considering all the possible variations encountered during evaluation. The mockups will be subsequently iterated upon after review and deliberation with the Design Team and other project stakeholders.\n\n3. Implementation and Testing Phase: The final approved mockup will be implemented in TailwindCSS. The element/component will be documented and tested. Once the implementation is approved and all tests pass the element/component will be incorporated into the framework.",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).",

A GSoC project in 2016 added an initial implementation for DAE solvers, namely, Ode 15 {i,s}, that use a variable step, variable order method , and is based on Sundials, to the Octave repository.\n\tThe major requirement now is to improve this implementation by creating an interface to SUNDIALS IDA API, using Octave's own classes and solvers, so that even SUNDIALS is not compiled against KLU (the solver used for sparse computations by IDA), a safety net is created for the end user such that sparse computations are never disabled in the Ode15{i,s} solvers, instead of falling to computing using dense implementations as before. This has the added benefits of avoidance in creating copies of data to send to SUNDIALS interfaces, as well as use of Octave's vectorized operations, allowing the solvers to be further optimized.",

To create a balanced project, we divide the project into 3 parts to deal with *present*, *past* and /future/ goals respectively. The *present* part aims to work towards 3.0.0 milestones, such as supporting the latest versions of Sympy & Octave and improving the CI. The *past* part deals with long-standing bugs that had fallen through the cracks, fixing those lost and forgotten bugs. Finally, the /future/ part will look at how we can improve maintainance going forward. We will try an experimental work based on the Pythonic project. That being said, exactly how far we get may depend on mentor guidance. In any case, our goal is to make octsympy easier to maintain in the future.",

      "description_html": "GNU Radio is a free & open-source software development toolkit that provides signal processing blocks to implement software radios. It can be used with readily-available low-cost external RF hardware to create software-defined radios, or without hardware in a simulation-like environment. It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.\n\nIn brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!\n\nYou can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronization elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.\n\nGNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.",

This lack of consistency and overall vision manifests itself in increased complexity, insufficient integration, and inefficient solutions, making the use of your computer more complicated than it should actually be.\n\nInstead, Haiku has a single focus on personal computing and is driven by a unified vision for the whole OS.

For years users have been frustrated by Haskell's conspicuous lack of support for namespacing features common in other languages. Haskell provides a limited form of namespacing with qualified imports, but using it to namespace field selectors tends to require hacky file structures. Fortunately, Haskell now provides `DuplicateRecordFields`, and GHC 9.2 introduced the `OverloadedRecordDot` language extension. These together provide a cleaner and more ergonomic interface for working with record types, a step towards better namespace support in Haskell.\n\nHLS already supports record dot-syntax to a small extent. For example, in the line `y = x.a`, type information is available when hovering over `y` or `x`. To unlock the full potential of this syntax though, HLS users should be able to \"dot into\" the record to see its fields, enabling IDE-driven API exploration. Additionally, type information for the `.a` part should be available to the user on hover. These are the main features I propose to add to HLS for this project.",

Designed with GHC-the-program as the sole consumer in mind, it is very difficult for newer tooling to reuse its components. These problems extend to the inclusion of new backends such that implementations for various target platforms forked GHC frequently.\n\nThe first step to improving the current design is the isolation of the different components and separation the codebase in layers for different purposes, described in the classic book \"Domain Driven Design\". This is already partly done, and in this project I join the existing effort by working on the next remaining subsystem: GHC's Core pipeline.\n\nIn order to achieve my goal, I will proceed by using an incremental bottom-up approach: Starting at the bottom of the module hierarchy, I will push references to upper layers module-by-module up in the callstack until they are completely removed from each component. For the entry points of each in-scope component, I will then provide component-specific configuration types and corresponding initialization functions. The in-scope components are specific configurable tasks of the optimizer, and the optimizer as a whole.\n\nWith this work completed, there will be significantly less references to the ubiquitous global states used throughout the whole compiler, namely the DynFlags and the HscEnv type, and significantly fewer imports of modules from upper layers, e.g. the driver.",

It would be beneficial to generalize GHC's runtime, make it separable from GHCSM, and connect it with a suite of different garbage collections from MMTk.\n\n\nTo achieve this goal, we propose to:\n1. Refactor GHC's runtime system to more effectively abstract over storage management operations;\n2. Introduce a storage management backend using MMTk's trivial no-GC collection plan;\n3. Integrate write barriers necessary for generational collection with MMTk;\n4. Introduce support for MMTk's semi-space and mark-sweep GC plans.",

          "abstract_html": "Conducting Cognitive Neuroscience Experiments has always been limited to research-grade EEG devices that cost tens of thousands of dollars. Since the conception of cheaper alternatives like MUSE, OpenBCI, etc - there have been an influx of consumer grade EEGs that allow the general public to have access to such devices. \nHowever, there is a lack of a standard and easy to use library to conduct and reproduce research on these devices. EEG - Notebooks provides the necessary software required to pull together the various enabling technologies necessary for running these experiments and analyzing the data. This can open dramatic new possibilities for both neurotech and cognitive neuroscience education, as well as more ambitious and large-scale research and clinical applications using large numbers of devices and or more naturalistic (out-of lab) settings. This leads towards the larger goal of contributing to the democratization of the cognitive neuroscience experimental world. \nIn its current state, the source code for the EEG-Notebooks experiment library is limited by its overly repeated and non-generalized code. This project seeks to tackle that issue by using classes and Inheritance to make the code easier to read, more extendable to the open source community, and a better experience for the general user. This will be instrumental in helping EEG-Notebooks move forward towards its goal of being the de-facto library for reproducing Cognitive Neuroscience Experiments on consumer-grade EEGs.",

This project will enable clinical neurophysiologists to upload EEG data in standardized formats; annotate data with artifacts, such as electrical noise and movement artifacts, using a novel ontology that is interoperable with the Hierarchical Event Descriptors specification; and export this data to the Brain Imaging Data Structure standard. While the resulting libraries of this project will be integrated into a Progressive Web Application for clinical neurophysiologists, they will also be released standalone as tools to further facilitate the development of neuroscience tools on the Open Web. This could reduce the barriers to entry for neurophysiology research by enabling standalone data management and analysis applications to be released on modern browsers.

NWB has thus exemplified as a sustainable biological data ecosystem, but there lies the need of converting readily available datasets into NWB format to allow for further sharibility and producibility. With that said, this project aims to (i) convert a publically available dataset into NWB format, (ii) ensure NWB datasets' compatibility with NWB explorer (NWBE), (iii) and facilitate generality of the conversion process by investigating the sources of NWBE-NWB incompatibilities and ensuring essential metadata being added.

With this optimization, simulation runtimes and GPU memory usage could be reduced, achieving a higher precision in DW-MRI simulations, which could bring us closer to the real and complex behavior of the system that shapes brain tissue.\nDisimpy is a GPU-accelerated diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance simulator that is used for developing and validating neuroimaging methods.\nDiffusion MRI is an imaging modality that provides us with information such as the orientation, the size, or the shape of neurons from the random displacements of water molecules in brain tissue. Water molecule diffusion patterns show how the molecules interact with the environment, revealing microscopic details about tissue structure, either sane or impaired.\nDiffusion MRI simulations require high precision to represent reality meticulously. Hence, optimizing the code that runs the simulation seems reasonable and extremely important. This study sheds light on this issue by proposing examples on how to improve the code, such as an optimization of Subvoxel-Triangle intersection algorithm, Ray-Triangle intersection algorithm, and the way of saving triangles and an implementation of a new feature that could allow the simulation of more complex systems.",

For this project, I will construct and simulate a PyGeNN model of the mouse primary visual cortex (V1) by reproducing the point-neuron V1 model created by Billeh et al. (2020). Taking advantage of GPU-acceleration, the PyGeNN model will be able to simulate V1 neural activity in real time. \n\nI will first implement a generalized leaky integrate-and-fire (GLIF) neuron class, which will govern the spiking behavior of neurons during simulation. Next, I will construct the network by connecting V1, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and background (BKG) neurons, using the parameters calculated by Billeh et al. (2020). To validate the model, I will compare the results of PyGeNN simulations to those of BMTK/NEST simulations. Finally, I will construct an application that simulates V1 activity in response to a webcam stream in real time. If time permits, I will enhance this application by implementing a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet LGN model, which will increase the maximum frame rate that can be simulated in real time. \n\nThe results of this project will include: (1) a complete model of mouse V1, (2) validation results and benchmark comparisons to BMTK/NEST simulations, (3) a webcam application showing simulated neural activity in real time, and (4) if time permits, a GPU-accelerated implementation of the filternet model.",

The brain imaging data structure format is a widely-adopted framework for disseminating clean datasets for use in the reproducibility of neuroimaging data analyses (https://bids.neuroimaging.io/). This project would aid in this pursuit by establishing built-in support for the BIDS format within the Pydra software package. Pydra is a library that allows complete control of the command line through Python (e.g., within a Jupyter Notebook). The majority of brain imaging data is analyzed using many commands that operate in a serial manner for cleaning, aligning, and applying statistical models to the data often in batches. Rather than relying on shell scripting and manual documentation of software versions, commands used, and outputs that are generated, Pydra can do so automatically. Pydra not only allows commands to be run through Python that would normally be run within the command line, but also unlocks the ability to interface with any CLI binaries a user might have installed as third party tools. Beyond this, Pydra allows the development of ‘workflows’ or stepwise processing pipelines with traceable software and command provenance, allowing an individual to essentially run an exact analysis in a “frozen” environment that the original publisher/researcher/scientist used themselves.",

          "abstract_html": "Biologically detailed models are useful tools in neuroscience, and automated methods are now routinely applied to construct and validate such models based on the relevant experimental data. The open-source parameter fitting software Neuroptimus (formerly Optimizer) was developed to enable the straightforward application of advanced parameter optimization methods (such as evolutionary algorithms and swarm intelligence) to various problems in neuronal modeling. Neuroptimus includes a graphical user interface, and works on various platforms including PCs and supercomputers. Neuroptimus currently uses various built-in cost functions and those implemented by the eFEL feature extraction library to compare the behavior of the models to the (experimental) target data. However, this approach severely limits the range of neuronal behaviors that can be targeted by the optimization. On the other hand, the popular model-testing framework SciUnit allows the implementation of tests that quantitatively evaluate arbitrary model behaviors.\n\nThe aim of the current project is to extend the open-source neural parameter optimization tool Neuroptimus so that it is able to use test scores from the SciUnit framework as the cost function during optimization. Direct applications would include the construction of detailed biophysical models of hippocampal neurons using a combination of Neuroptimus and HippoUnit, an open-source neuronal test suite based on SciUnit.\n\nDeliverables:\n1. Implement changes in the Neuroptimus core so that it is able to use SciUnit test scores as cost functions during optimization\n2. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that arbitrary combinations of built-in cost functions, eFEL features, and SciUnit test scores can be used\n3. Implement changes in Neuroptimus such that the new features become accessible from the graphical user interface\n4. Thoroughly test the newly implemented features and their integration with existing features of Neuroptimus",

          "abstract_html": "Event-based vision is a subfield of computer vision that deals with data from event-based cameras. Event cameras, also known as neuromorphic cameras, are bio-inspired imaging sensors that work differently to traditional cameras in that they measure pixel-wise brightness changes asynchronously instead of capturing images at a fixed rate. Since the way event cameras capture data is fundamentally different to traditional cameras, novel methods are required to process the output of these sensors. In addition to dealing with ways for capturing data with event cameras, event-based vision encompasses techniques to process the captured data - events - as well, including learning-based techniques and models, spiking neural networks (SNNs) being an example.\n\nThis project aims to create benchmark datasets for object recognition tasks with event-based cameras. Using machine learning solutions for such tasks requires a sufficiently large and varied collection of data. The primary goal of this project is to develop Python utilities for augmenting event camera recordings of objects captured in an academic setting in various ways to create benchmark datasets. A secondary goal of this project is to test the performance of spiking neural networks for object recognition on the created datasets.",

While there are tools that provide LaTeX to XML conversion (as required by PMC), no single tool does it seamlessly without errors for the template corresponding to NBDT. The current project aims to build an application providing this functionality. The project will build over the LaTeXML tool to enhance custom bindings as required for NBDT submissions. The first step would be to enhance the bindings for body matter, as Scholastica (which hosts NBDT) already provides it for front-matter binding. In addition, to make the application platform-independent, it will be extended to provide custom front-matter and back-matter bindings. It shall also contribute verification engines to automate XML verification, JATS verification, and PMC-specific verification. The application shall make it convenient to bridge NBDT submissions and the PMC archival process.",

The editors simply need to provide the abstract of the paper or the paper URL, and the output is a sorted list of potential reviewers.\nApart from speeding up the workflow of choosing the reviewers for the paper, this approach also promises to minimise the bias introduced during reviewer selection- The algorithm would be optimised to account for potential conflicts of interest between any of the authors and the reviewers while assigning reviewers.",

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\n\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need for any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.\n\nMotivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.",

          "abstract_html": "The audience of IHR largely consists of researchers, network operators, policymakers, and educators. The goal of the proposal is to make the IHR’s internet application an end-to-end solution for stakeholders to work on. Currently, the IHR website provides plots of internet latency and routing for AS and countries. The goal of this software subsystem is to add new plots showing speed test data collected by Measurement-Lab so that users can monitor how disconnections and routing events impact throughput. While providing the users with a quick lookup for the NDT test it becomes immensely important to co-relate IHR traffic analysis with Google and Cloudflare reports. Collecting data from similar services would also pump IHR’s anomaly detector to complement IHR’s alerting system. With IHR the hub for multiple network reports and metrics, it is vital to have a dashboard to customize visual data. I propose to develop a customized IHR dashboard that is self-exploratory. The dashboard would let end users explore the IHR dataset and monitor any event with respect to time and legends according to their purpose. The dashboard would let the user select a set source and destination networks, time periods, and a metric and correspondingly plot the data.

There exist various types of Internet data, mainly, tabular data (e.g., ASN or latency value), timeseries (e.g., AS hegemony per day), graphs (e.g., routing graph), paths (e.g., traceroutes, BGP paths). We will create at least one building block that can visualize each type of data. Different types of data need different types of visualizations. We will consider a range of visualizations, such as, sankey diagrams (very useful to visualize relations, paths, etc. in Internet data), graphs, geo-maps, distribution plots (e.g., histograms, violin plots), dendrograms, heatmaps.",

Currently, most of erddapy's functionality is concentrated into a single class, and the URL building features are implemented in that class along with the data transformation methods that process server responses into Python objects, such as Pandas DataFrames.\n\nThis project proposes to separate erddapy into core and object (or opinionated) layers. The former will hold the URL building and data transformation functionality, which will be reused by the rest of the library. The latter layer will provide high-level objects that will support a functional API that does not depend on the state of the underlying object (which is the case for the current version of erddapy). This functional API will provide cleaner iterative usage when querying multiple servers and datasets, and new classes implemented in the object layer will support serialization so that they can be pickled and passed on to other processes or machines.\n\nTo execute this project, I delineate two separate aims: refactoring the URL building and data transformation functionality into a new module containing minimal, standalone functions and reusing those functions in the existing primary class; and implementing an additional layer containing the high-level objects that will provide the basis for the functional API. Overall, this will greatly improve the flexibility and scalability of the package, and will help support its wide spectrum of users.",

It uses Hyper Parameter Optimization to tune the language runtime layers of a given application.\nSystem component metrics can give a better look into what is happening inside them. Metrics are particularly useful for building dashboards and alerts.\nKubernetes components emit metrics in Prometheus format. This format is structured plain text, designed so that people and machines can both read it.Following are four common methods of hyperparameter optimization for machine learning in order of increasing efficiency:\n1.Manual\n2.Grid search\n3.Random search\n4.Bayesian model-based optimization\n\nThe aim of Bayesian reasoning is to become “less wrong” with more data which these approaches do by continually updating the surrogate probability model after each evaluation of the objective function.\nAt a high-level, Bayesian optimization methods are efficient because they choose the next hyperparameters in an informed manner. The basic idea is: spend a little more time selecting the next hyperparameters in order to make fewer calls to the objective function. In practice, the time spent selecting the next hyperparameters is inconsequential compared to the time spent in the objective function. By evaluating hyperparameters that appear more promising from past results, Bayesian methods can find better model settings than random search in fewer iterations.So,this project aims at tuning kubernetes applications using bayesian optimization.",

It’s an innovative tool because it’s creating the test once and testing with any version of the tested software. EAT is available for a number of server configurations and a CI pipeline can be built using the maven tool. The goal of the present project is to extend EAT with new features and tools. The implementation of the project is estimated to last from June to November (Large Size Project) and the timeline is envisaged as follows: During the 1st Phase (June 2022 - July 2022) a snapshot will be added for testing the latest version of JBoss Community Server. The newly added snapshot will be made available for use with the CI builds. Moreover, the extension of EAT with additional multiversion android projects (described at the second phase) will begin. Continuing to the 2nd Phase (July 2022 - September 2022), new multiversion Android projects will be added to EAT. In EAT there is already a basic android  multiversion example. This will be extended with other open source android projects demonstrating how EAT can be used to support multiversion real life android projects. Finally, during the 3rd Phase ( September 2022 – November 2022) a multi-version Android application will be developed and added to EAT. This app will enable users to upload  and view descriptions and ways of usage for various programs or functions.  The users will be able to upload the descriptions of projects related to EAT, how they can be used and other project related information. The documents will be proposed for acceptance and when accepted they will be stored in  e.g. google drive, from where they will be accessible for anyone interested.",

Building robotics applications is a complex task. Integrating existing nodes or libraries that provide already solved functionality, and using several tools may increase the software robustness and shorten the development time. JdeRobot provides several tools, libraries and reusable nodes. They have been written in C++, Python or JavaScript.\n\nOur community mainly works on four development areas:\n1.- Education in Robotics\n* RoboticsAcademy (https://jderobot.github.io/RoboticsAcademy/): a ROS-based framework to learn robotics and computer vision with drones, autonomous cars.... It is a collection of Python programmed exercises for engineering students. \n* Unibotics: a web based framework for teaching robotics.\n\n2.- Robot Programming Tools\t\n* VisualCircuit (https://jderobot.github.io/VisualCircuit/) for robot programming with connected blocks, as in electronic circuits, in a visual way\n* VisualStates for robot programming with Finite State Machines in a visual way\n* WebSim2D robot simulator with web technologies\n\n3.- MachineLearning in Robotics\n* DeepLearningSuite: neural networks for robot control. It includes the BehaviorMetrics tool for assessment of neural networks for autonomous driving\n* RL-Studio: Robotic library for the training of Reinforcement Learning algorithms\n* DetectionMetrics tool for evaluation of visual detection neural networks and algorithms\n\n4.- FPGAs in Robotics\n* FPGA-robotics (https://github.com/JdeRobot/FPGA-robotics): programming robots with reconfigurable computing (FPGAs) using open tools as IceStudio and Symbiflow. Verilog-based reusable blocks for robotics applications.\n* NeuralFPGA: running deeplearning networks on FPGAs",

Instead of asking the user to code the solution in a web-based editor, they will have to upload a deep learning model that matches video inputs and outputs the image coordinates of the detected humans. In this project, the support for neural network models in the open ONNX format, which is becoming a standard, is one goal. The fluent exercise execution is also a goal, hopefully taking advantage of GPU at the user’s machine from the RoboticsAcademy docker container. An automatic evaluator to test the network's performance provided by the user will also be explored. All the above functionalities have, to some extent, already been implemented in the exercise. The goal is to improve/refine them either on the existing implementation or from scratch.",

Jenkins' motto is \"Build great things at any scale\". Using an extensible, plugin-based architecture, developers have created hundreds of plugins to adapt Jenkins to a multitude of build, test, and deployment automation workloads. As Jenkins is open-source, MIT License is used for most of the components.\n\nThis year we invite potential GSoC contributors to join the Jenkins community and to work together to improve Jenkins. We have many strategic project ideas which are important to potentially hundreds of thousands of Jenkins users.\n\nThe project has over 600 active contributors working on Jenkins core, plugins, website, project infrastructure, localization activities, etc. In total we have more than 2,000 components including plugins, libraries, and various utilities. The main languages in the project are Java, Groovy and JavaScript, but we also have components written in other languages (Go, C/C++, C#, etc.). Jenkins project includes multiple sub-projects (including Configuration-as-Code, Infrastructure and Remoting) and special interest groups. These entities participate in GSoC as a part of the Jenkins project.\n\nThe Jenkins project is a part of Continuous Delivery Foundation (CDF).",

While the CLI is very powerful and user friendly, it should be used by power users (release team who installs and manages jenkins x clusters). We should not expect developers who are concerned with only the pipelines to install the cli (This does not scale when you have 100+ developers in the company) We do have a UI/dashboard, but it is read only, so users cannot use it to trigger release pipelines or stop running pipelines. In addition, we do not have an audit trail of who did what. So, we propose a new UI/dashboard which has feature parity with the CLI (including SSO and RBAC) The UI should make the JX cli redundant, and add more value to the user with easily available status and logs of the entire cluster",

          "abstract_html": "Data is the new big thing for search engines in today’s time but it can be difficult for web crawlers to effectively interpret the context of the data. To deliver better search results, web crawlers need to have a context of the data and to understand the data better, structured data is used. Structured data is the data which conforms to a data model, has a well defined structure, follows a consistent order and can be easily accessed and used by a person or a computer program. It is used by search engines to generate rich snippets, which are small pieces of information that will then appear in search results making the search results more relevant.\nCurrently Joomla! has rich snippets implemented but it uses inline microdata to implement rich snippets which is difficult to modify from the backend as it is hard coded into the html. With this project I’ll be working on to making it easier for the user to dynamically integrate structured data from the backend. \nFor the dynamic integration of structured data I’ll be using schema.org which provides a universally recognized format for structuring data on the Web. There are different ways to implement schema markup but for this project I’ll be using JSON-LD as it can be inserted into the web page without disrupting other contents or HTML and it is easy to store in the database. This project will help user to add, update or delete schema markup on the articles from the backend. It will give user an option to select the type of schema from the available schema types and then insert values for the attributes of schema properties in the form. Some useful data which is already present in other forms will be fetched using AJAX Interface and it will be directly inserted into the JSON object. After saving the article, the generated schema will be pushed into the head element of the page.",

Those who use Joomla! will prefer a basic help text and interface over reading bulky documentation for any action they want to execute. Though it is properly detailed in an easy manner in the documentation, the user has to visit a separate link for documentation. It would be easy for the user if he/she can get that on the same page without any redirection and in the form of some iframes.\nIt could be better if this would be a complete tour of the click-through path as that will increase the convenience for users in a much more professional and better way and even to make this feature more user friendly, a user can create custom tours as per the requirement.\nAlso, this will allow third-party developers to ship their own tours with their extensions which will make it easier for the users, who will use the extension to be familiar with the same.",

This score is based on four criteria which are factors sabotaging image: blur, noise, exposure, and compression. The current approach is useful to determine images distorted by one of these reasons. However, the current algorithm presents also some drawbacks : It demands a lots of fine tuning from user's side and it's cannot work on aesthetic image. So, I propose the solution of deep learning algorithm. While the dataset and the paper for aesthetic image quality assessment are free to use, we are capable of constructing a mathematical model that can learn the pattern of a dataset, hence, predict the score of quality. As deep learning is an end-to-end solution, it doesn’t require the setting for the hyperparameters. Hence,  we can reduce most of the fine-tuning parts to make this feature easier to use",

They access these permissions through Portals (in Flatpak's case) and Interfaces (in Snap's case).\n\nDiscover is KDE's application for installing software. Presently, Discover can show what permissions are necessary by Snaps and Flatpaks, but lacks a mechanism to change Flatpak's permissions. Flatpaks can access buses, but it is unclear what these buses do, to users. Snaps do offer a mechanism for changing these permissions within Discover's interface (through a popup), but this has 2 problems: first, the permissions will not be understandable to most users; second, the method of displaying these permissions is inconsistent with how it is done for Flatpaks.\n\nThe project's goal is to implement a mechanism to alter these permissions and their extents in a system settings module for each application, and show Snap permissions in a more informative, easier-to-digest way on Discover's interface, like for Flatpaks.\n\nPLAN TO IMPLEMENT:\nThe project is broken into 2 stages: the first is implementation of the feature that allows tweaking of Flatpak's application. This should be done by the end of Week 7. The second is the feature to display Snaps permissions more informatively on Discover's interface, like it is done for Flatpaks. This stage will take up the remainder of the weeks. \n\nDELIVERABLES:\n1. mechanism to alter Flatpak permissions through a System Settings module for each application\n2. mechanism to alter Snaps' permissions through a System Settings module, for each application\n3. displaying Snap permissions with additional information such as brief descriptions and icons in their application pages\n4. implementation of an \"internal dictionary\" to explain what access level to each bus on the system implies to the user",

For tutorials, Codelabs is also used. While extremely handy for smaller projects and initial versions of Keptn, this toolchain has serious deficiencies for larger-scale projects like Keptn.\n\nI am going to propose a New Documentation Site Engine that will be based on Docusaurus. Docusaurus is an optimized site generator in React. Docusaurus helps you to move fast and write content. Build documentation websites, blogs, marketing pages, and more.\n\nThe main focus of Keptn New Documentation Site Engine will be managing large-scale documentation and complex documentation projects. So two major things which are needed in the documentation engine are Multiple repository docs support and Versioning of Docs support.\n\nFind my detailed GSoC 2022 Project Proposal at https://github.com/iamrajiv/GSoC-2022/blob/main/GSoC_2022_Project_Proposal.md.",

Implementing features like filtering DNS requests and blocking the particulars would help in maintaining privacy and protection. \nIn this project, I would be working on the client-side approach for creating the blocker. The blocker would work across different platforms including- Desktop, Android, Linux and Mac. For developing the UI Components of the blocker, I will go with QT5 as the LEAP projects use the same. And for the Android implementation, I will be using Java and Android-specific XML.\n\nFirstly, in the main desktop client- the features of blockers would be included in the settings menu along with a simple feature switch. Pre-configured blocking lists would be shipped with each release. This would help us in filtering out the DNS requests and blocking the IPs in our target blocking list.\nI will package the entire solution in a self-contained Go Library that will be able to read packages from a given file descriptor and work accordingly.\n\nFuture Scope includes implementation in iOS environment and  implementing update mechanism.",

Its main purpose is to provide an\neasy and convenient way to organize learning resources and build channels for Kolibri.\nUser Experience is a really important aspect of Kolibri Studio as it may involve multiple\nusers working on the same content curation unit (channels). Delayed reflection of the\nmodified state of a channel to a collaborative user may cause inconvenience and may even lead to repetitive change to the same entity.\n\nThe current setup for Real-Time Communication in Studio involves maintaining a\nserver-side log which is being simulated by calling the POST method of sync API. All\ncollaborative users are hitting this POST method at regular intervals to post any changes made by them (if no changes are made then the empty changes array is posted) and receive any changes made by other users as a response of this method.\n\nThe proposed WebSocket architecture will neutralize and reduce the load on the server which is currently being created due to continuous polling of the APIs. It will convert the complex underlying structure of Sync API into a simple real-time-friendly architecture in which a full-duplex communication between client and server takes place.

          "abstract_html": "Premature birth is highly prevalent with every one in ten births being premature. A common complication in premature birth is hypothermia (the baby cannot regulate its body temperature). Low-middle income settings limit access to neonatal incubators and radiant warmers. Thus, there arises a need to develop low-cost solutions to support premature newborns in their early and vulnerable stages of life. KMC (Kangaroo Mother Care) is a technique widely practiced to provide thermal support to newborns. During KMC, a caregiver maximizes contact with the newborn by laying the newborn, skin-to-skin on their chest. Since KMC is a highly burdening activity, the caregiver might need breaks for personal care making the baby vulnerable to a loss of a thermal source. The patented NeoWarm device is a low-cost solution to this problem. It not only augments the natural KMC session by providing extra heat but also regulates and monitors the temperature of a newborn even when the caregiver-newborn dyad is not engaged in KMC (standalone mode). The NeoRoo app provides a digital interface to the NeoWarm device by monitoring the vitals of the baby over BLE and sending alerts to responsible medical professionals and parents if the baby's vitals are found to be abnormal. It also establishes a mode of communication between the medical professionals and the guardians of the baby so that there are shared goals, coordinated tasks along with exchange of information for better neonatal care.",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.\nLibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.\nWe believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.\nThough the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution & skills.\nThe community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.",

The goal of this project is to extend support for Z compressed graphic formats, namely .wmz and .emz, which currently can't be opened by LibreOffice.\n\nThe second goal of this project is to implement saving functionality for .svgz, .wmz and .emz. While .svgz is an option in the save dialog, it is incorrectly implemented (no compression actually happens, it's just an svg with a different extension).\n\nThe plan is to create a new and extensible way that uncompresses the file buffer after determining if its compressed from its header,and try to open the uncompressed file buffer.\n\nThe plan for the second goal would be to find a way to determine whether the file we're saving needs to be compressed (either by checking the extension or by creating a new option in the file saving dialog) and compress the file buffer before saving. This is not as easy as it sounds, as we need to factor in various pitfalls such as what happens when there's not enough RAM to hold the temporary compressed buffer for example.\n\nDeliverables would be an extensible way to load and save Z compressed files, an exhaustive unit test suite, which will test file detection, graphic loading, pitfall handling behavior and ready made test files.",

      "description_html": "Liquid Galaxy is a remarkable panoramic system that is tremendously compelling. It started off as a Google 20% project to run Google Earth across a small cluster of PC's and it has grown from there! \nLiquid Galaxy hardware consists of one or more computers driving multiple displays. Liquid Galaxy applications have been developed using a master/slave architecture. The view orientation of each slave display is configured in reference to the view of the master display. Navigation on the system is done from the master instance and the location on the master is broadcast to the slaves over UDP. The slave instances, knowing their own locations in reference to the master, then change their views accordingly.\nThe Liquid Galaxy Project, while making use of Google Earth software, does not develop the Google Earth code-base itself. Google Earth is not open-source software, although it is free (as in beer). Instead, the Liquid Galaxy Project works on extending the Liquid Galaxy system with open-source software both improving its administration and enabling open-source applications, so that content of various types can be displayed in the immersive panoramic environment.\nArtificial Intelligence focus:\n2023 was the AI year, and as the mainstream market demands, 2024 and the coming years will still be a very hot topic. At the Liquid Galaxy community, we’ve been using AI for years to obtain data to be shown on Google Earth for our projects, using TensorFlow and more. Last year we made some specific advances incorporating an Artificial Intelligence server inside our rig LAN, managing with dockers the different projects, implementing local models for different functionalities, and having artificial voices in our system. Also last year we incorporated Google’s Mediapipe-based project Gameface to be able to control the Liquid Galaxy just with your face! \nThis year also we’ll allow the use of Cloud-based services, like Google’s models Gemini and Palm2.",

          "abstract_html": "Until today, playing games has become an activity loved by many, mainly due to the fun and competitiveness offered to those who play them. In Liquid Galaxy, a few games were developed that are supported by the cluster system, such as the Galaxy Pong, Galaxy Snake and more, in which lots of them were based on old famous games.\nOne of the first major hits of arcade games was Asteroids, released in November 1979 by Atari, Inc. The player controls a spaceship in an asteroid field and the objective of the game is to increase the score by shooting and destroying the asteroids and saucers, while not colliding with either or being hit by the saucers' shot. The game gets harder as new asteroids spawn.\n\nFollowing this logic, the project's idea is to remake the original Asteroids game, with a modern design and new features, such as the multiplayer mode. It would be really nostalgic and fun to be able to play it again, especially for those who played it back in the 80's and 90's. Moreover, due to its complexity, uniqueness and system support, the project may be a part of the Liquid Galaxy demonstration, bringing more emphasis to the lab.",

It uses master-slave architecture and multiple displays to create an immersive environment. This project is based on an android app where users can plan the reforesting missions, by defining areas of seeding, specific seed/tree location, drone landing points, fly zones, and other helpful metrics. All the gathered information is dynamically displayed on the Liquid Galaxy cluster using KMLs and also on the app with the help of graphics and text to bring users a great and immersive overview of the mission panorama. This project will help in developing the next generation of this android app which includes advanced features like Flight Plan Tools and Drone Visualization. We'll also be adding the ability to import data from external storage services and the ability for the app to work with different languages. We'll be building the new UI for the seamless integration of these features and by the end of the GSOC period, we'll be delivering an android app that has all these new abilities listed above.",

We segregate the KML data into the various tracks to get a more neat visualisation of the different Map data, such as Lava flow, Historic flow, Earthquake Magnitude, Detected events, Located events, Affected areas, etc. Then we write the code to send KML data from our Flutter app to the Liquid Galaxy to visualise this data on the Liquid Galaxy rig. We store all the web scraped data in the assets so web scraping is no longer needed once data of all tracks is gathered. Also, for a user-friendly interaction experience, the movements we do on the Google Maps is detected and Google Earth of the Liquid Galaxy can be moved. Other important features are the multi-language plugin and day/night theme that gives a better user-experience.",

The name \"LLVM\" itself is not an acronym; it is the full name of the project.\n\nLLVM began as a research project at the University of Illinois, with the goal of providing a modern, SSA-based compilation strategy capable of supporting both static and dynamic compilation of arbitrary programming languages. Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.\n\nIn addition to official subprojects of LLVM, there are a broad variety of other projects that use components of LLVM for various tasks. Through these external projects you can use LLVM to compile Ruby, Python, Haskell, Rust, D, PHP, Pure, Lua, Julia, and a number of other languages. A major strength of LLVM is its versatility, flexibility, and reusability, which is why it is being used for such a wide variety of different tasks: everything from doing light-weight JIT compiles of embedded languages like Lua to compiling Fortran code for massive super computers.",

The Generative Adversarial Networks(GANs) have achieved similar performance as the full Monte Carlo based simulation, but with reduced time taken. As quantum computers promise many advantages over classical computing, comes a question on whether quantum machine learning (QML) can give any improvement in solving the problem. This project aims to demonstrate quantum machine learning's potential, specifically Quantum Generative Adversarial Network (QGAN), in HEP events data generation and classification from image data. Although many previous works have tried to classify images with QGAN, none of them is fully quantum. This project will be aimed at producing new 'accurate' data with a fully quantum implementation of QGAN, along with integrating it with the Physics channel of the LHC e.g. the Higgs-Boson production event.",

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have previously been used to successfully distinguish between distinct types of substructures such as no substructure, vortex substructure, and spherical substructure. In this task, we'll classify images based on whether or not they have a strong lensing effect. Strong Gravitational Lensing allows us to analyse the substructure of dark matter, allowing us to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying nature. The observed strong lens images may be utilized in the Deeplense pipeline for dark matter substructure classification, anomaly detection, and interpretation. Images may be processed using a variety of algorithms. We'll try out several types of models, fine-tune them to obtain good outcomes, and compare them. Because a single model may not be sufficient, we can combine the findings of several models using ensembling to obtain a more robust and better outcome. We'll document and record every outcome as we experiment with our models. We will also provide starter notebooks  describing how to train and test the models so that it will be easy for anyone to understand our work.",

This is where Machine Learning proves to be useful for such classification tasks. The proposed project introduces an novel approach for Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks, a quantum machine learning technique to solve high energy physics problems like regeneration and classification of large data. This project aims to demonstrate quantum machine learning's potential in solving critical high energy physics problems that seem to be intractable using classical techniques.

The DeepLense pipeline combines state-of-the-art deep learning models with strong lensing simulations based on lenstronomy.

          "abstract_html": "In recent years, the convolutional neural network has been successfully applied in particle physics identification tasks. Despite its great success, the existing image-based methods for particle suffers from data sparsity. Motivated by this question, we plan to represent the particles data in graph and find the most suitable graph representation method in this project. Then, we will build various graph neural networks for end-to-end tau identification with the cutting-edge methods in current graph deep learning research. Furthermore, we will analyze the model performance from multiple perspectives and try to interpret what the networks have learned through training. Lastly, we will benchmark model inference on GPU and provide user guidance through documentation and code. This project will give some insights into the application of Graph Neural Network in tau particle identification and is expected to help the ML4SCI community conduct research in future work.",

I will achieve this by creating a Python library that exposes methods to create, update and search on encrypted indices stored in content repositories in a Matrix homeserver.\n \nAs a part of the project I will be demonstratively integrating the library into an existing Matrix client.

It has been developed at the Dipartimento di Scienze e Tecnologie Aerospaziali (formerly Dipartimento di Ingegneria Aerospaziale) of the University \"Politecnico di Milano\", Italy. MBDyn features the integrated multidisciplinary simulation of multibody, multiphysics systems, including nonlinear mechanics of rigid and flexible bodies (geometrically exact & composite-ready beam and shell finite elements, component mode synthesis elements, lumped elements) subjected to kinematic constraints, along with smart materials, electric networks, active control, hydraulic networks, and essential fixed-wing and rotorcraft aerodynamics. MBDyn simulates the behavior of heterogeneous mechanical, aeroservoelastic systems based on first principles equations. MBDyn can be easily coupled to external solvers for co-simulation of multiphysics problems, e.g. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), terradynamics, block-diagram solvers like Scicos, Scicoslab and Simulink, using a simple C, C++ or Python peer-side API. MBDyn is being actively developed and used in the aerospace (aircraft, helicopters, tiltrotors, spacecraft), wind energy (wind turbines), automotive (cars, trucks) and mechatronic fields (industrial robots, parallel robots, micro aerial vehicles (MAV)) for analysis and simulation of complex systems dynamics. The extension of available analysis domains to new models and the introduction of new analysis domains is planned, and problem-driven: if you need to solve a specific problem, let us know. Run-time loading of user-defined modules is leveraged to let users extend the feature library (elements, drives, constitutive laws, and more). On GNU/Linux, real-time execution is supported under RTAI, the Real-Time Application Interface, and POSIX tight scheduling.",

      "description_html": "MDAnalysis is a Python library for the analysis of computer simulations of many-body systems at the molecular scale, spanning use cases from interactions of drugs with proteins to novel materials. It is written by scientists for scientists and is used for cutting edge research in biophysics, chemistry, soft-matter physics, and materials research around the world in academia and national research labs. MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it.\n\nThe goal of MDAnalysis is to make it easy for users to analyze data that are produced by simulations (primarily molecular dynamics simulations) that run on some of the largest supercomputers in the world. MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for new computational tools.\n\nMDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the Protein Databank format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks. Welcoming documentation such as the User Guide https://userguide.mdanalysis.org/ make it easy to get started. New releases are downloaded a few thousand times and the academic papers describing MDAnalysis are cited more than almost two thousand times, indicating the widespread use in the academic community.",

      "description_html": "When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for instance, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is frequently error-prone, time-consuming, and does not add any value to the final product.\n\nThe main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or any other language.\n\nMetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures, which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.\n\nIt addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python or any other language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages.\n\nFinally, we are using the polyglot runtime in cloud computing so we take advantage of the interoperability capabilities and allow to build complex polyglot distributed systems with ease. It is possible to build monolithic and mono-repo projects that can be distributed and scaled separately through our Function as a Service built on top of MetaCall, allowing the developer to maximize the productivity without the need of DevOps plumbing or thinking about intercommunication protocols and architectural details.",

The framework is written in the Ruby programming language and includes components written in C, many flavors of Assembly, Python, Powershell, PHP, and other languages.\n\nThe framework consists of tools, libraries, modules, and user interfaces. The basic function of the framework is a module launcher, allowing the user to configure an exploit module and launch it at a target system. If the exploit succeeds, the payload is executed on the target and the user is provided with a shell to interact with the payload. Hundreds of exploits and dozens of payload options are available.",

          "abstract_html": "This project is to enable the selection of multiple blocks at the same time and allow moving and doing actions on multiple blocks on Blockly. This behaviour is pretty much the same as when you try to manage your files on your Operating System, and you can drag a rectangle to select multiple files, then moving them around, copying, deleting.\n\nThe design is that the Blocks multi-select feature will be only functional when you hold the Shift key, so that users can still drag the workspace when not. Users can simply click on the blocks to select or unselect them, or drag a rectangle to select a set of them at the same time. A button would also be added to enable multi-selection feature in case users are unable to access the keyboard.\n\nIt sounds like a little bit easy, but actually, I would say that it's not. Multiple selections can become a crazy-complex feature when you start thinking about the details. When dragging two blocks, you have to think about how the connections will work. When you right-click on multiple selections, you also have to make sure that those options apply to all blocks. And the touch screen problem would also need to be addressed.\n\nThe feature request (https://github.com/google/blockly-samples/issues/267) has remained open on the GitHub Issues for 6 years, but it's still in the discussion phase and far from the beginning of Implementation there. So I hope we can implement that during GSoC 2022 if possible.",

Before the effect was implemented, the pitch could be changed only using the deck's rate slider separately. Unfortunately, the mentioned Pitch Shifter has no wide range and imposes significant restrictions on ways other effects can interact with the sound. In this project, the new Pitch Shift effect is introduced in the built-in effects, which can be used in the effect chain. It implements the wish \"Add a Transpose / Pitch Shift effect\" for the Mixxx software. Primarily, it allows a user to use a much wider range, than the Pitch Shifter for the deck player and, of course, other useful options like Formant Preservation or semitone chromatic scale mode. Due to the produced latency based on the pitch processing, the production delay has to be handled for the Dry/Wet and Dry+Wet modes to ensure that the original (dry) and processed (wet) signals overlap. The project is expanded by the implementation of the Group Delay handling for the effect chain.",

The UI library aims to considerably improve the design & development workflow and meet the acceptable web accessibility requirements for potential users. A UI library helps to mitigate popular UI-development issues like inconsistent user experience, performance issues, accessibility requirements, and more. To achieve this, a centralized collection of components would be developed which will encompass the color branding of moja global, typography, spacing, buttons, modals, and forms. The big picture is that the UI library will allow all the upcoming moja global projects, with a client-facing focus, to have a consistent design language that will help us to quickly and easily build their user interface.",

However, there is still plenty of work to do before this feature is mature enough and compatible with MoveIt's mainstream branch.\nConcrete steps: \n1) Use MoveIt's code standards. \n2) Address the compatibility issue. Define a workflow to allow users to use this new feature without enforcing it on everyone. \n3) Optimize our previous approach to make it faster and safer to use with robots moving at high speeds. \n4) Document the approach, as well as, generate test cases for MoveIt's Continuous Integration system.",

It supports unlimited staves, linked parts and part extraction, tablature, MIDI input and output, percussion notation, cross-staff beaming, automatic transposition, lyrics (multiple verses), fretboard diagrams, and in general everything commonly used in sheet music.\n\nStyle options to change the appearance and layout are available and style sheets can be saved and applied to other scores. In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.\n\nMuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.\n\nThe team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.\n\nAll members provide bug tracking support and feedback.",

However, the datasets produced by mass spectrometry instruments are complex and multi-dimensional. MZmine (https://mzmine.github.io) is a very successful open-source graphical software for mass spectrometry data processing implemented in Java. It contains a library of processing algorithms and powerful visualization modules. The publication about MZmine 2 (Pluskal et al., BMC Bioinformatics 2010) has received over 2500 citations, reflecting the impact the software had in the biomedical research community. A new version, MZmine 3, which is currently in the final stage of development, is based on JavaFX for its user interface and provides support for cutting-edge techniques such as ion mobility separation. Our main goal is to provide user-friendly, flexible, and easily extendable modular software covering the entire mass spectrometry data analysis workflow. MZmine previously participated in GSoC in 2017, 2018, and 2019 as part of the OpenChemistry umbrella organization and in 2020 as an independent organization.",

Biomedical research is increasingly dependent on knowledge expressed in terms of networks, including gene, protein and drug interactions, cell-cell and viral-host communication, and vast social networks. Our technologies enable researchers to assemble and analyze these networks and to use them to better understand biological systems and, in particular, how they fail in disease. \nThe NRNB mentoring organization includes projects such as Cytoscape (https://cytoscape.org/), WikiPathways (https://wikipathways.org/), SBML (https://sbml.org/), and SBGN (https://sbgn.github.io/). This is a great opportunity to work at the intersection of biology and computing! For example, Cytoscape is downloaded over 18,000 times per month by researchers. We take mentoring seriously and are proud of our 95% success rate (https://www.nrnb.org/alumni.html#gsoc-tab) with former students and projects. But don’t take our word for it, read testimonials from prior NRNB students (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#student-tab) and (https://www.nrnb.org/testimonials.html#mentor-tab).",

Conversion to SBML format from SBGN or SIF is lossy since the data models are not fully compatible. Information may be lost during conversion to SBML format. This is why supporting the SBML format in Newt is crucial. The main feature proposed to be implemented is for users to create SBML models from scratch in Newt without the need to convert them to other data formats. An additional palette will be added with the corresponding notation to the existing palette for the user to create new SBML models or edit an existing one by dragging elements from the palette.",

It will also implement a quota system to prevent abuse of computing resources.\nThis will be accomplished by using a predefined SSH connection to the facility. Instead of user holding the private key and moving the public key to the remote submit node, the server holds a database of all remote nodes and for each node it creates a separate public and private key pair.  The public key will be copied to the remote node. The private key would be saved on the server. Whenever an authenticated user tries to connect to a particular submit node in the HPC facility, the private key for that node will be fetched by the server and will be used to authenticate the user against that remote node and there will be no need for the user to configure and enter any private key at all. Thus there will be just one private key for all users of a particular submit node. Server will also keep a tally of all the users that are currently using the server's private key at the moment. This will help implement a quota system to ensure that the resources are not maxed out.\nOver the span of 12 weeks, a customized version of cloud COPASI will be produced that will provide an easy to use interface for UConn users to submit their jobs and get results in quick time.",

The overall goal of the project is to address these issues by developing Jupyter notebooks showcasing COMBINE standards and libraries.\n\nThe notebooks will be developed around one common theme; the famous repressilator model. The project will demonstrate how to construct, encode, visualize, simulate, annotate and distribute computational models using COMBINE standards and libraries. This project will contribute open resources which will \n\n● introduce and educate newcomers to standards for computational models. \n● aid in navigating the vast online resources available in this area by providing a common entry point. \n● provide an interactive introduction to the libraries with code examples for important examples. \n● provide testing of COMBINE libraries via Continuous Integration (CI).\n\nThereby this project will add an important contribution to the field of systems biology and network biology.",

          "abstract_html": "The study of urban morphology relies on clever abstractions of the built environment into computationally tractable models. One such model, the street network, is a graph whose edges are streets and nodes are street intersections. Network analysis tools are often tailored for street networks with the purpose of routing. In shortest path computations, network data must carefully reflect not only urban infrastructure but also the intricacy of transportation policies–such as multiple lanes and traffic direction. From the perspective of urban morphology, these features add noise to the geometric order of cities. Perpendicular two-lane streets cross in four intersections, producing a dummy city block, for example. Street networks carefully processed to answer pressing accessibility questions are not suitable for morphological analysis.\n\nWe would like to develop source-agnostic functions to process street network data for meaningful morphological analysis. The final network should be, at least, free from multiple nodes representing the same intersection and multiple edges representing the same street. This processing must rely on inherent network properties such as node connectivity and edge lengths, but not on auxiliary data such as OSM tags and building footprints. The functions will be collected under pysal’s momepy module, added to an existing toolbox of scalable urban morphological analysis.",

The idea of the project is to develop a set of tools within the current momepy.preprocessing module that combined with the current integration of NetworkX can output a solid, consistent and repeatable analysis of the urban form. \nGiven that other libraries have also approached this issue (namely osmnx.simplification and citiyseer.tools.graphs), the idea is to contribute from the persisting issues of such libraries to then continue with a solution that is much more independent. Issues like multiple Points on LineStrings, snapping ends, and curving segments have already been addressed by such tools, but parallel LineStrings, and enclosed Linestrings (eg. round-abouts) still need to be resolved, to name a few. It seems that a categorization of the different topological issues (likely similar to the ones just mentioned) could create a framework from which to approach a final pipeline. However, it is proposed that early tests of different potential avenues be performed to sketch a planning route going forward (one of such tests is exemplified under the Approach section). The ideal solution is expected to be source-agnostic, but also leverage the current efforts already done by the community.\nOverall, the idea is to prioritize work alongside the mentors and the community to focus on increasing the short-term benefits of all PySAL/GeoPandas users (some of whom might already be familiar with some of the other corrections). As the project progresses over different iterative approaches, it is expected to incorporate more performance tests to counterbalance the feasibility of each approach as well as to build the desired autonomy of the tools to be reliant exclusively on input geometries.",

This gets prohibitively expensive even for a few thousand training data points.

          "abstract_html": "Electromagnetic devices have become ubiquitous in our lives due to their limitless applications. For designing and optimizing such devices, non-uniform and unstructured meshes are essential, due to the multiscale nature of the problem. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is well known for handling such meshes. FEniCSx is an open-source platform for solving partial differential equations with the FEM, offering high-level Python and C++ interfaces. It has become a popular choice among FEM users, especially for solid mechanic and fluid dynamic applications. However, FEniCSx has not met the same popularity for electromagnetic applications due to the lack of comprehensive demos showing how to correctly setup and solve electromagnetic partial differential equations, and therefore many researchers and engineers in this field prefer to use other (often commercial) FEM platforms. This proposal aims to solve this issue by developing extensive and accessible electromagnetic demos for a number of case studies. In particular, the work will focus on delivering at least five demos (plus tests and documentation), regarding 1) the use of complex numbers, the implementation of 2) Scattering Boundary Conditions, 3) Perfectly Matched Layers, and 4) Maxwell's equations for axisymmetric structures, and 5) the parallelization of a parameterized problem with the MPI COMM_SELF communicator.  These additions will be a step towards the extensive use of FEniCSx in the electromagnetic community since they will provide working tools for real-world problems. The demos will also be a show-reel for new features of FEniCSx that have not been covered in past demos or tutorials. A long term effect of this work could be more developers involved in the FEniCSx project, more guiding feedback from end users, and promotion of open source software for electromagnetic/photonic simulations.",

          "abstract_html": "For simulating a system that contains many variables and/or equations, traditionally computational engineers tend to focus on utilizing an appropriate method with realistic time and space complexity. The technique of model order reduction (MOR), however, aims at approximating the original model with reduced number of variables and/or equations and still keeping sufficient accuracy. MOR is especially useful in various industries, for example thermal-fluids engineering, micro-electro-mechanical systems and control, where large-scale simulations have to be performed.\n\nThe methods of model order reduction can be classified into several classes including proper orthogonal decomposition, reduced basis, balanced truncation, etc. Several MOR libraries have been well developed in MATLAB and Python. For instance, pyMOR is a Python library that relies on the application of reduced basis methods to parameterized partial differential equations. MATLAB's model reducer supports pole-zero simplification, balanced truncation mode selection methods and so on.\n\nIn Julia, the main package that enables symbolic modeling is ModelingToolkit.jl, whose key features consist of automatic transformation and structural simplification, but it needs further works on fast ML approximate transformations. So this project is targeted on implementing MOR methods as extended features for ModelingToolkit.jl. Besides implementation of methods of model order reduction, the expected deliverables will include documentation which shows both the improved simulation time and accuracy penalty for the application of different MOR methods on test problems from various disciplines.",

This 350-hour project will study consider a set of interface designs for standardized use across the library’s statistical modeling packages and implement one such design in a development version of the library. If time permits, another aspect of this project that may be tackled is the extension of R-style Wilkinson formulas to spatial models via a Python package such as patsy or formulaic (Wilkinson and Rogers, 1973).",

          "abstract_html": "Graph Isomorphism is an exciting topic regarding networks, but also a fairly complex problem to solve. The goal of the project is the full implementation of the VF2++ algorithm, which is an improved version of the original VF2 algorithm, extended to directed and multigraph settings, in a nonrecursive manner. \n\n\nThe brief description of the original algorithm (VF2) is that, after verifying  that both the input graphs have the same number of nodes and the exact same degree sequences, it starts constructing a mapping, between the nodes of the two graphs. If the mapping can be extended such that, every node from the first graph is matched to a node of the second graph, then the two graphs are considered to be Isomorphic.\n\nThe imporved version (VF2++), performs a preprocess, during which, a matching order is found, such that the algorithm is able to recognize the feasibility of the examined branches, avoiding a significant amount of computations by excluding the infeasible ones. \n\nThe plan to solve the problem is the following.\n\nStep 1: \nextensive research, questions asked and ideas discussed with the mentors. Establishment of a clear understanding of the topic is crucial.\n\nStep 2: \nDecomposition of the problem into smaller and more distinct, less complex sub-problems. These are basically the helper functions that are eventually going to be combined to form the final result.\n\nStep 3:\nStrict testing and reviewing the implementations throughout the entire process. Feedback from the community and the mentors regarding the progress so far. \n\nStep 4:\nImprovements based on the obtained feedback, application of optimizations, possible extra new features added.\n\nStep 5:\nIntegration of the final algorithm into the software of NetworkX. Possibly requires the creation of a wrapper class, hosting all the created functionalities.\n\nStep 6:\nDiscussions about further improvements out of the scope of GSoC. For example, parallelization with the help of tools such as Cython.",

          "abstract_html": "Currently, exact inference for Gaussian processes within PyMC makes heavy use of Cholesky decompositions that have a cubic asymptotic time complexity. Fortunately, modern hardware such as graphical processing units (GPUs) can improve the computational efficiency of large vector and matrix operations. While this hardware doesn't greatly benefit Cholesky decompositions, an approach called \"blackbox matrix multiplication\" (BBMM) has been developed for exact inference of Gaussian processes. BBMM efficiently utilise the benefits of GPUs, leading to quadratic asymptotic time complexity. This project aims to replace Cholesky decompositions required for inference of Gaussian processes with BBMM and similar methods, leading to massive improvements in computational efficiency for Gaussian process inference in PyMC.",

          "abstract_html": "Multi-output Gaussian processes (MOGPs), a type of Bayesian nonparametric models, have recently gained strong attention from researchers, and become an active research topic in machine learning’s multi-task learning. The advantage of multi-output GPs is its capacity to simultaneously learn and infer many outputs which have the same source of uncertainty from inputs. This provides a useful and practical approach for various applications in different fields. \n\nThe creation of new sampling methods and the advance in computing power have paved the way for the development of Bayesian models. Different software frameworks have been built to facilitate this probabilistic programming approach. Among those, PyMC is one of the most popular frameworks with a large and strong community. PyMC provides friendly interfaces that allow users in academics and industries to perform both parametric and nonparametric Bayesian data analysis. For Bayesian nonparametric models, the Gaussian process module in PyMC supports various mean and kernel classes. However, the current GP implementations in PyMC are limited to single output. This project aims to add support for multi-output GPs in PyMC. This feature would significantly extend the capabilities of this important module and benefit the PyMC community.",

          "abstract_html": "Analyzing positional features/annotations in sequences is important in bioinformatics. Visualizing such data is quite a challenging task, considering the large amount of data to be displayed. The feature viewer is an open source javascript library developed to visualize biological data (referred to as features) mapped to a linear sequence (Paladin et al., 2020). For instance, it can be configured to visualize the location of protein domains or amino acid variations in a protein sequence. The feature viewer is being used in several popular bioinformatics resources such as neXtProt and COSMIC 3D.\n\nCurrently, the feature viewer supports limited configurability options in the features displayed, such as the color, shape and on-click behavior. This is too restrictive for some of the possible use cases of the feature viewer, where more flexibility is required in the display of features. One such instance is when different types of amino acid variants should be displayed in a color-specific manner in the same feature track.\n\nThe overall goal of this project is to improve the configurability of the feature viewer, such that it allows greater flexibility in the visualization of detailed biological data.",

The main idea of this project is to solve and implement the problem of finding this optimal transformation when it is constrained to be a positive semi-definite matrix.\n\nPSDP and its analog problems (like the nearest correlation matrix problem) have applications in molecular alignment, structure analysis, quantitative finance and machine learning.\n\nAs a part of the project, the intended contributions are two-fold. Firstly, the aim is to extend the Procrustes library to include algorithms solving PSDP as a new class of Procrustes problems along with benchmarking the implementations. Secondly, the plan is to introduce additional extensions to the library involving solutions to the PSDP problem where the trace, diagonal elements, or other linear constraints over the transformation (i.e., the matrix) are imposed.",

Once the tool is equipped, RDKit users will have another way to construct a molecule.\n\nThe core work of the project will involve working on reimplementation of the Python programs function's. The main two steps of the program are 1) deriving atomic connectivities from coordinates and 2) determining the most favorable bond ordering from atomic connectivities. Atomic connectivities are found using either the Huckel method or through consideration of van der Waals radii. Favorable bond ordering is determined by considering different possible valences. The project is hence split up into these subparts. Bond ordering, atomic connectivity, formal charges, and the molecule’s conformation, among a few other factors, are combined to create an RDKit mol object.",

          "abstract_html": "The Open Food Facts database contains a lot of information on food products, such as ingredients, labels, additives etc. To link this information to useful properties such as Nutri-Score, Agribalyse and many more, taxonomies are used within the database.\n\nA taxonomy in Open Food Facts is a raw text file containing a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each leaf node has one or more parent nodes. It is mainly used for classification and translation of various food products within the database. Hence, taxonomies are at the heart of data structures in the Open Food Facts database and must be maintained properly.\n\nThis project provides an User-Friendly interface developed for editing taxonomies with ease. This tool is helpful for contributors to visualize a node's translations, properties, parents and children in a single page. The editor allows users to perform CRUD operations on the taxonomy and on the nodes present. A fast search mechanism for finding nodes within the taxonomy has also been implemented successfully.\n\nThe introduction of Taxonomy Editor will be very beneficial, as it will help to visualize how products are classified and would encourage more contributions from the wonderful community of contributors of Open Food Facts.",

Biological pathways model the set of actions that molecules in a biological cell can perform. What the MP-BioPath does is model the activity of certain biological pathways, helping to predict the response of the pathways to external perturbances. The MP-Biopath tool already exists, but has not been made accessible through the FI Viz Cytoscape Plugin, which is an app designed to analyze the pathways involved with diseases such as cancer. My job would be to incorporate the MP-BioPath tool into the FI Viz Cytoscape Plugin and develop customized visualizations for showing the result of MP-BioPath.

Our main goal is to promote Openness.\nGFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance  is a platform for Open Standards, Free Software, Open Content, Open Data & Open Hardware in Greece. The major Greek Universities and Research Centers participate in GFOSS – Open Technologies Alliance, while leading members of the Greek community of developers play a key role in the implementation of our policies. Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advises on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e.g. https://howto.gov.gr/ - https://forma.gov.gr/) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (https://openedtech.ellak.gr/ )",

          "abstract_html": "The project I want to focus on is developing a more compact version of DIY robot for younger students,opposed to the more modular design it currently has . This robot will have a compact design with little or no expandability in order for the students to engage more in the robot’s programming and understand various concepts. For that reason, we will have to ensure the robot’s resilience to avoid accidents and make it durable.\nApart from that, I plan on developing use-case scenarios in greek, ready to use by the teachers, including course objectives and possible extensions for each one.It would be nice to also develop extensive and simple guidelines of how to print and assemble the robot for everyone to follow, despite their technological background.\n\nSince we want the students to focus on programming and learning to develop their own algorithms, it is important to develop an easy-to-use, kids-friendly environment, preferably a desktop app, integrating Google’s Blockly. During the last GSoC, an API system was developed, so that using Blockly is expected to be easy. So, I would love to connect both the compact version and the full one with Scratch/Blockly following ELLAK ‘s aesthetics, like this existing prototype. The app should be colourful and have an interactive design, specially designed for students, also having multiple pop ups and information about their actions and whether they were successful or not. I would like to turn programming into a fun activity, so that the children can learn while having fun.\nHowever, since Blockly’s integration requires modifying the core library, I plan on rewriting some parts of the Raspberry Pi’s code  concerning movement control. There will be a custom functionality library for special control of every electronic part and sensor.",

Thin-film deposition is an important manufacturing step in the production of many opto-electronic, solid-state and medical devices and products, including consumer electronics, semiconductor lasers, fiber lasers, LED displays, optical filters, compound semiconductors, precision optics, microscopy & microanalysis sample slides, and medical implants. The computational simulation of thin-film deposition can offer insight into deposition processes and guide the development of technologies that streamline or enhance the thin film deposition process. Therefore, Apothesis can be a valuable tool for scientists and engineers working in this field. \nHowever, Apothesis’ applicability to many problems and popularity is severely limited by the settings (species growth/deposition geometries, processes) that can be specified by the user and the very specific input format (JSON format) that is not widely used in the scientific community. This project aims to improve the I/O operations and generalize them so that users/scientists can easily use it in an extended set of deposition processes.",

In addition, the Blockly graphical UI will be extended with configurable blocks that will allow the easy though fine-grained operation of the robot. This project will be developed in collaboration with Open Technologies Alliance (GFOSS), as it will be based on the previous GSoC projects of the applicants of 2019 and 2021. It will refine the robot assembly guidelines, manual for the installation of the software stack (which will be automated as much as possible in order to support the continuous integration of software updates), and will extend the stack both in terms of the front-end of Google Blockly and the back end code in order to facilitate the robot operation and programming.",

However, as highlighted by a recent study, the research on compiler testing has critically neglected the front-end component of compilers, leaving unfound bugs in the type checking procedure of compilers. More specifically, this could lead to the compilers of statically-typed languages, which utilize features such as type inference, both accepting erroneous programs and rejecting correct ones.\r\nHephaestus is a tool designed to test the compilers of three languages, namely Java, Kotlin, and Groovy. It has already successfully detected over 150 bugs in the compilers of these languages. I propose a way to extend Hephaestus for it to be able to successfully test and detect bugs in the compiler of TypeScript. This can be a great contribution to the user-base and community of TypeScript, a language that has risen in popularity and usage in the past years.\r\nHephaestus detects bugs by:\r\n1.\tgenerating semantically-valid programs that (a) utilize parametric polymorphism and (b) are abstract\r\n2.\tgenerating these programs in an intermediate representation (IR), an OOP language that supports parametric polymorphism and type inference\r\n3.\tusing translators to convert the abstract IR program to the desired language.",

          "abstract_html": "[Problem]\nOpenAFS is a distributed file system. Currently, it has \"File ID\" or FID to \"entry\" or name lookup functionality, AKA, reverse lookup and also normal lookup, which is “name” for a given FID [afs_dir_Lookup and afs_dir_InverseLookup]. afs_dir_InverseLookup is currently computationally expensive because the algorithm scans a hash index data structure embedded within a \"Directory object\" [src/dir/dir.h] looking for a name that matches the given FID. It is not performant as it's merely brute-forcing the search.[src/dir/dir.c]\n\n[Solution]\nMaintain a separate hash table to store reverse lookup information with key: FID and value: name, the opposite of the existing hash table within in the Directory object. I would create this hash table within the Directory object again because it could avoid the penalty of maintaining a global data structure where all the information could be stored, and would also avoid the unnecessary loading of information of the entire volume, if only one file is looked up. Global table for all directories could also perhaps not scale to really large volumes. A \"lazy\" allocation of this table, that is, fill it in only when the first request is made per Directory Object for a \"reverse\" lookup would be efficient.\n\n[Deliverables]\n1. Code\n - Update the existing data structures [DirHeader], hereby referred to as DS.\n - Change the afs_dir_InverseLookup code to use the new DS\n - Lazy load* the information into the DS when the first request is made to “reverse” lookup.\n - Update the code* wherever directory updates are present (like adding and deleting a file inside the directory)\n * Ensure the synchronization primitives are correctly used\n \n2. Tests\n - Correctness tests: check if the written code is working as expected. Asserts can be added to ensure both the hash tables are coherent.\n - Performance tests: check the speed of execution of the current code vs the new code in the same environment (HW and OS)\n\n3. Documentation updates.",

[FLASH](http://flash.uchicago.edu/)) or designing interplanetary trajectories for human-made spacecraft. The analysis of such data helps multiple types of research, from being able to forecast solar storms to detect planets in other stars, to understanding how galaxies are formed to explain the expansion and the origin of the universe.\n\nOpenAstronomy is currently formed by [16 organisations](http://openastronomy.org/members/) that develop tools for different aspects of astronomy. The range of topics covered by these projects is wide, for example: \n- [Astropy](http://astropy.org) is a general Python library for astronomy, providing common tools such as celestial coordinates, image processing, tabular data  reading and writing, units and support for astronomy-specific file formats; \n- [SunPy](http://sunpy.org) provides utilities for obtaining and representing solar physics data, with clients for some of the largest online solar physics data archives and solar specific analysis and visualisation code;\n- [Glue](http://www.glueviz.org/) is a data visualization application and library to explore relationships within and among related datasets.\n- [Julia Astro](http://juliaastro.github.io/) is a set of packages for general astronomy and astrophysics analysis using Julia;\n- And more!\n\nAs a single organisation, we aim to strengthen collaborations between the different sub-organisations, and at the same time increase the awareness among our users on the capabilities of our \"sister\" projects.",

One important aspect of time series analysis of astronomical sources is to identify and characterize their variability from their light curves. The light curves of these sources are affected by spurious variability from variable backgrounds and gaps due to occultation or inaccessibility of the source. This causes data to be affected by Poissonian uncertainties. In the case of sources that are near to detection limit of telescope, these uncertainties are dominant.\n\nBayesian Excess Variance (Bexvar) is a statistical method to measure variability in Poisson-distributed data. The method has been developed to analyze X-Ray light curves of faint sources observed by eROSITA telescope. Bexvar is a Bayesian formulation of the excess variance method.\n\nThe aim of this project is to implement this method in Stingray, create test cases for the method based on real observational data and write appropriate documentation.",

Therefore, its most commonly used interface are Gnuastro’s command-line programs. However, Gnuastro’s also has an extensive set of installed, dynamic C/C++ libraries, which are the actually beating heart of the programs. On the other hand, many projects today are done in Python, almost excuslively using Numpy for their numerical operations (like data arrays). \nPython and Numpy are actually written in C, therefore they have very well-defined interfaces for communicating with installed C libraries, using CPython. Since both Gnuastro and Numpy's core data structure are very similar, we plan on building a converter between the two. This will make it possible to perform all data operations using Numpys C-API. This will be followed by adding a low-level wrapper infra-structure which will allow easy usage of Gnuastro’s powerful libraries in Python.\nThus, the final goal is to have Gnuastro be an importable module in Python (just like Numpy) and have all the inner data operations of Gnuastro be performed using Numpy's C-API.",

However, there is a need for models that are closer to the human brain and can solve multiple tasks. Multi-task learning (MTL) is a branch of machine learning, in which multiple tasks learn simultaneously through a shared model. It has the following advantages: improving data efficiency, reducing overfitting through shared representation, and using auxiliary information to learn quickly.\nThe project has four objectives:\n1. One or more multi-task CV models trained (or borrowed, if the license is appropriate), and submitted to OpenCV model zoo. Specifically, at least MCN or networks with similar functions should be successfully transplanted or improved for OpenCV, and the accuracy and less computation should be provided, which is not lower than that of the existing single OpenCV model.\n2. quantize the model on the condition that the accuracy does not decrease too much. At least try to quantize the model and make a trade-off between performance and effectiveness at the end.\n3. Necessary patches, if any, for OpenCV DNN to support the provided multi-task models. Ideally, there should be an API introduced to optionally disable some parts of the multi-task CV model and save time by not computing unnecessary parts/heads of the model.\n4.

          "abstract_html": "Object detection has made great progress in the past few years along with the development of deep learning. However, most current object detection methods are resource hungry, which hinders their wide deployment to many resource-restricted usages such as usages on always-on devices, battery-powered low-end devices, etc. This project would aim to propose the use of tiny-DSOD for resource-restricted usage. This considers the resource and accuracy trade-off for resource-restricted usages during designing the whole object detection framework. Based on the deeply supervised object detection (DSOD) framework. Tiny-DSOD introduces two innovative and ultra-efficient architecture blocks: depthwise dense block (DDB) based backbone and depthwise feature-pyramid-network (D-FPN) based front-end. We conduct extensive experiments on the COCO benchmark and compare Tiny-DSOD to the state-of-the-art ultra-efficient object detection solutions such as Tiny-YOLO, MobileNet-SSD (v1 & v2), SqueezeDet, Pelee, and Faster-RCNN.",

The reason for the performance issue is speculated to be redundant instructions introduced by the wrapper class. And the fundamental problem is that the current design of Universal Intrinsic may not suitable for variable-size(size-less) architecture.\n\nSo it would be nice to modify the API and implementation of universal intrinsics forvariable-size architectures. And the goal of this project is to optimize the current Universal Intrinsic for RVV, mainly including the following two points. 1. Reduce the overhead of using wrapper class and 2. Support for multiple VLENs\n\nThe expected outcomes of this project is mainly including 1. a new Universal Intrinsic backend for RVV to opencv_core module 2. a new test cases (modify or add) and make it pass on QEMU",

          "abstract_html": "Valhalla is a routing engine built on OpenStreetMap data, that allows for high flexibility by providing diverse routing modes and routing filters. \n\nInitially, Valhalla received transit data from Transitland API, which converts GTFS (General Transit Feed Specification) data into a database. However, Transitland data is no longer compatible with Valhalla due to their internal updates. To bring back transit routing support to Valhalla and make it less reliant on third-party software, it can receive transit data from GTFS directly. \n\nThere are downsides of simply updating the code for Transitland: (a) it is dependent on OpenstreetMap, making Valhalla heavier, while GTFS can be independent, (b) Valhalla is still vulnerable to future changes in Transitland code that may break the code.  Therefore, this proposal is for an independent integration of transit data from RAW GTFS, rather than being dependent on a third-party platform.",

          "abstract_html": "Nominatim is OSM’s own geocoding software. When a user is searching for a specific place, Nominatim returns multiple results that are likely to be what the user is looking for. These search results are ranked based on their importance values that are being derived from looking at the popularity of the locations’ Wikipedia articles. However, not every place on Earth has its own Wikipedia article. As a result, each of the places that do not have their own Wikipedia articles does not have an assigned importance value to be used to rank them correctly among the other locations in the search result. OSM publishes aggregate map access numbers that are generated based on the users’ behavior when using the map. These access numbers are a good indicator of how popular a place is. The aim of this project is to integrate the map access numbers into Nominatim to compute an importance value for all places regardless of whether they have their own Wikipedia article or not. In order to fulfill the aim of this project, a set of deliverables needs to be defined and accomplished. These are:\n\n1) Finding the most suitable method of importing GeoTIFF files \n2) Developing the import functionality\n3) Investigating and developing the importance value computation algorithm based on the map access numbers\n4) Writing unit tests\n5) Documenting the new changes",

In machine learning, 3D or 4D representation provides more depth information than the 2D representation, many of the tasks may be much better understood if we provide a 3D or 4D. But OpenVINO has no native real-time 3D visualization engine or library. This can be very troublesome for users who use display 3D images. So our goal is working natural 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO (AI inference). There are a few solutions in Jupyter 3D graphic display, though:\n\n1. Requires complex setup, build or is not friendly to the average user (without graphics programming experience)\n2. Not integration with OpenVINO(Need process different data and different inference results available from OpenVINO, the user only needs a simple interface to set this up)\n\nThe project idea aims at fill in the gaps mentioned above:\n\n1. Provides a clean interface to set up the display of these graphics without the need for a graphical programming background(beginner-friendly)\n2. 3D support for Jupyter Notebooks running OpenVINO(Be able to transform and process the output data of OpenVino)",

We envision a world where access to high-quality education is not a privilege but a human right. \n\nThe team works on two platforms: \n\n    (a) Oppia Web, which provides an online learning tool that enables anyone to learn from effective and engaging interactive lessons (called 'explorations'), which simulate a one-on-one conversation with a tutor. This format makes it possible for students to learn by doing while getting feedback. The Oppia Web platform also provides the infrastructure needed to support lesson creation and translation.\n\n    (b) Oppia Android, which provides a way for these lessons to be played offline on an Android app that supports low-end devices and does not require Internet connectivity. \n\nAs a community, we are also aware that millions of students in underserved communities lack access to the educational resources necessary to effectively learn key skills like basic numeracy. Thus, in addition to developing the Oppia platform, the team has launched and continues to develop a set of free and effective lessons on basic mathematics, supplemented by translations and voiceovers. Students using these lessons have shown strong improvements between pre-and post-tests, and we’ve received lots of positive feedback on them. We are planning to extend this offering to other subjects, based on what students (and the nonprofits working with them) tell us would be most useful.",

          "abstract_html": "Oppia frontend codebase is fully typed, but our typing doesn’t yet pass strict TypeScript checks. This means that variable assignment, procedure parameters, and function return values will all be clearly connected with a type. Strict is a typescript compiler option that enables a set of tougher type rules that, when enabled, assist lower the possibilities of producing surprising outcomes and make the code more resilient, but Oppia's code base presently fails to pass these stringent requirements. As a result, the code is vulnerable to unexpected actions and failures. To avoid this, modify the strict TypeScript config file such that all newly-added files must be strictly typed, and Introduce strict typing for about 280 twins of files, as well as tests for those files (for a total of 560 files), and ensure that no more unknown type is used, as well as removing all unknown type usage from the newly strictly typed files. The document also lays out the whole implementation approach for the idea, as well as the milestones I'll need to fulfil to finish this project.",

We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in the habitat of the Southern Resident Killer Whales (SRKWs) to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks they make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.  \n\nSince a Kickstarter in mid-2017, [key members of our community](http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/) have built a [web app](live.orcasound.net) that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7. Version 2 of the app, launched in May 2020, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. \n\nOrcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery. For example, [orcanode](https://github.com/orcasound/orcanode) holds Python code and shell scripts that generate the live audio stream in lossy HLS format to optimize audio playback within modern browsers and lossless FLAC format for scientific analysis.",

We are required to train neural networks streams of audio data to separate marine mammal vocalization sounds (orcas and humpback whales) from other background noise like that of ships and other vessels. Next, we have to train two different neural networks- one for classifying the whale vocalization sounds and the other one to classify ship noises. The second part of the project involves building an efficient vessel monitoring system. We will use AIS data to detect and track larger commercial vessel and some private yachts. The non-AIS boats can be tracked using RADAR and camera data using Marine Monitoring system. Once we are done training all the models, we can deploy the detectors on the cloud and on the Jetson Nano.",

OWID uses a range of choropleth maps, but size-scaled maps have downsides, primarily because human visual perception associates areas with importance. Furthermore, readily available alternatives use mosaic cartograms, which distort the shape of countries.\n\nTo solve this problem, in a sentence, the primary objective is to plot a visually conclusive world map by illustrating territories/countries using a method for trading off shape and area.\n\nThe basic idea of the solution is to distort the size-scaled world map while preserving the shape of countries to generate a population-scaled world map. Furthermore, a manually generated population-scaled world map acts as the reference for optimizing the cost function for better results.\n\nFinally, an option to rearrange the cells in the grid to nitpick the details yields the final result of the cartogram.",

Then on the UI side, you have options to put text in blocks. A block will contain text, a time interval in the video and an image we\nwill show at that time interval. That’s how we can make multiple blocks after submitting the data. We will call the backend REST APIs in Django or flask, which will take those data blocks containing time intervals images and text.

          "abstract_html": "With the increase in use of technology and the internet, the risks associated with the internet are also increasing at a very high rate. Hence, it is necessary to have a system in place to protect our systems from such risks. The risk of malicious attacks is especially higher when browsing the internet. Thus, there is a need for an external system to intervene and block any unauthorized requests to the web server. A web application firewall(WAF) does just that. Modsecurity follows the OWASP Core Rule Set(CRS) rules to detect any vulnerabilities. This helps make web browsing more secure. The CRS has different Paranoia Levels which represent different security levels. At higher paranoia levels, the system has a stricter set of rules to block malicious activities. However, at such high paranoia levels, many genuine requests also get blocked as they resemble malicious activities. These are known as false positives. Such a large number of false positive detections hinders the user experience and as a result, they may stop using CRS and compromise security. Hence, it is important to reduce the number of false positive detections. As the data isn’t labeled, using an appropriate unsupervised learning algorithm is the best possible way to achieve this. With the existing proposal by Floriane Gilliéron as a basis, I would work on an unsupervised learning algorithm for the machine learning plugin and aim to get it integrated as an official plugin. I will also add additional features to the plugin.",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are not necessarily limited by the need to collect new data as much as by our ability to synthesize existing data. This project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Because no one measurement provides a complete picture, multiple data sources must be integrated in a sensible manner. Process-based models represent an ideal framework for integrating these data streams because they represent multiple processes at different spatial and temporal scales in ways that capture our current understanding of the causal connections across scales and among data types. Three components are required to bridge this gap between the available data and the required level of understanding: 1) a state-of-the-art ecosystem model, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model.",

It bridges the gap between polystores and hybrid transaction/analytical processing (HTAP) systems. In contrast to most existing polystore systems, Polypheny offers support for data manipulation queries. Furthermore, it features a flexible schema, supporting schema changes at runtime.\n\nPolypheny is a full database management system providing support for a rich set of data types. Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.\n\nMoreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows combining different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.\n\nPolypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features adapters for directly querying CSV files or file systems. Thanks to GSoC 2021, Polypheny now even has support for querying the Ethereum Blockchain.\n\nThe JDBC, Python and REST query interfaces allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. It supports a broad spectrum of query languages including SQL, CQL, the MongoDB query language and the Pig query language. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.\n\nIn conjunction with the support for multimedia data and workloads, Polypheny offers a flexibility not matched by existing database systems.",

Currently,  Pgperffarm is using Pgbench of the same dataset & queries and different configurations. The main problem with Pgperffarm is that the variety of benchmark tests supported now is too limited. To improve and enrich the functionality of Pgperffarm, implementing custom queries for Pgbench is needed. So are additional benchmarks like TPC-h and YCSB. The web frontend should be changed to be dynamically generated from Django templates. The backend also needs new functionalities like email notifications for various purposes.",

AF_XDP, like DPDK, can be used to bypass the Linux kernel to gain high-performance processing network packets.  DNSDist acts as a load balancer and often needs to process and forward packets. Therefore, in order to forward DNS requests DNSDist needs the raw network packets processed by the Linux kernel network protocol stack, read its request, and send the same request to the downstream DNS server again through the Linux kernel network protocol stack. The repeated processing of the same or similar data by the Linux kernel network stack is an unnecessary overhead for the server deploying DNSDist.

That said, generating a GIF out of a given animation is not particularly straight forward. We are aiming to solve this problem, among other bug fixes and whatnot that may come with — or be related to — it.",

A powerful Machine Learning library can expand the possibility of Processing by enabling the users to create cool AI-powered art, games, and interactive applications. Furthermore, a well-implemented ML library in Processing can be an effective tool to lower the barrier of AI/ML and teach ML to beginners in a friendly way. Though there are some ML libraries such as OpenCV for Processing and Deep Vision for Processing, there is no one universal ready-to-use ML library that is friendly for beginners. Additionally, the speech/audio models and text models are not supported by any of the existing libraries. By using Deep Java Library's extendable high-level API, this library resolves the aforementioned issues by enabling powerful pre-trained models from Deep Java Library's model zoo, including speech/audio and text models.",

As well, the ability to participate in and browse the showcase should not be hindered by one’s physical abilities, thus increasing accessibility will further BOND the community, especially in the parts of the community that are not as well represented.\r\n\r\nThis project will deliver three stages of changes: the community approach, the support, and the narrative. The community approach will implement a hashtag and social media challenge to expand community discussion/bonding beyond the showcase launch date. The support phase will focus on tweaking specific functions to greatly improve UI and accessibility, as good design will open up the p5 community/showcase to underrepresented communities, such as the impaired. Lastly, the narrative phase will introduce the implementation of an \"Explore\" tab alongside of the current \"Gallery\" tab, which will encompass a digital gallery that allows viewers to freely explore the works and create their own narratives, adding more personality/personal voice to each submission.",

While the WebGL components of p5.js are increasingly robust, there are a number of open issues that point towards some unexpected behavior and a lack of documentation around certain features. There is also the challenge of structuring the WebGL functions in a way that achieves parity with the p5.js approach to 2d rendering. \r\n\r\nThere are a number of bugs that I would like to resolve, including #5455, #5631, and #5440. For documentation, it seems necessary to make certain additions to better orient developers who are new to 3D graphics and shaders, including graphics quirks that go beyond p5.js, such as the depth sorting challenges mentioned in issue #5420. I would also like to contribute documentation that helps users better understand the structure of WebGL in p5.js, information that is currently only available within the contributor documents. Additional examples would also be helpful for topics like setting up an effects chain or for achieving certain effects such as feedback.",

A machine-learning algorithm may perform differently on datasets with different characteristics (e.g., it might perform better on a dataset with continuous attributes rather than with categorical attributes). Taking into account all the possible pre-processing strategies, there exists an extremely large number of options and non-experienced users become overwhelmed. A lot of research has been done for providing help and an overview of the different steps of data analysis. The focus, however, has usually been on the model training step, and data pre-processing has generally been overlooked.

This Fourier-transformed sensor data can be used to infer data within the brain in a very similar way as the time-series data but with an added, fifth dimension for frequency. MNE-Python has all the components necessary for time-frequency source estimate viewing and would be greatly improved by integrating them to allow for exploration of this complex data. A graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to look at regions of high power spectral density, while letting the user dynamically adjust the range of frequencies, would be incredibly helpful for allowing this kind of data to be explored and analyzed. The ability to browse slices has already been implemented in `mne.gui.ieeg_locate` and could be abstracted to be used in this case. Time-frequency plotting of spectrograms, with appropriate units and baseline correction already exists in MNE-Python as well. Putting these elements together into a GUI would be a great improvement for the MNE-Python tool and community.",

As part of this initiative, I will be implementing Automated Machine Learning (autoML) to accelerate end-user's ML workflows . \n\nTo do so, I will integrate common hyperparameter tuning techniques (grid search, Bayesian optimization, evolutionary algorithms etc.) with DFFML's array of different models ranging from GBTs to NNs, and optionally ensemble learning, in order to return the best-performing model to the user. At the end of the project, users will easily be able to perform autoML with any dataset from their CLIs using DFFML, and the process will be clearly documented and tested for the benefit of both users and future contributors.",

The idea is to make an improved version of the course in Spanish, with an interactive environment for the students, that allows them to visualize and try active code on the site (made possible thanks to the Runestone library). Currently some of the lectures in the course are not interactive due to the limitations of the Skulpt interpreter. I propose to make these exercises interactive by using the recently added Brython interpreter and other libraries that can used to mock the libraries used to teach the lectures. Apart from this I also plan to add interactive web development intro lectures using web2py framework, that can greatly benefit the students who may use this course.",

It enables users to integrate Fortran code into Python easily and quickly. F2PY has been in maintenance mode since 2009, ever since it became feature-complete for Fortran 77. Beginners browsing its codebase in the current state might find it challenging to read, understand and contribute. The frontend of F2PY is a handwritten command line parser that predates the intrinsic ‘argparse’ module by several years.\n\nThis project will include modernising the CLI with the “argparse” python library, simplifying the frontend codebase and making it more developer-friendly to contribute to.\n\nSince “np.distutils” is set for deprecation, I propose adding an option to build the F2PY’s generated CPython extension modules with Meson. Meson will significantly speed up building standalone extension modules through the F2PY CLI. There is no change proposed to the process of generating C and Fortran wrappers from Fortran source files. Generation of the source code for integration in Python projects will be carried out in the same way. Currently, “np.distutils” is used by F2PY to build generated extension modules. Adding a Meson backend will provide faster builds and long-term backend support for F2PY.\n\nAdditionally, I plan to re-implement the class-based test-suite of F2PY in a modern pytest manner and add a developer’s guide to F2PY.",

During the program, I will migrate the services to newer versions and add some interesting features in the comment section, notification section, labels , etc. After this program user story will be ready to use by EOS and other organizations. The main objectives of my proposal are-\n1. Migration to typescript\n2. Migration to Strapi V4\n3. Revamping  the notification section\n4. Making  the comment section user friendly\n5. Adding more UI/UX solutions\n6. Removing existing bugs.",

Sometimes for example they should do in different altitudes the same pattern. Therefore we need an option to add another flightpath on a view. Also it should be possible to toggle the active state, so that it is possible to alter data. On toggling a flightpath the data table gets updated.\n\n\n- the server can use categories to filter existing flight paths. After some defined time a flightpath should be moved to inactive state to have the UI showing only current flightpaths. There should be an option for the creator to reactivate an inactive flightpath and also inactivate one.\n\n\n- invite link to operations Besides that one creator can add others to an operation, we want an option to get invited. by clicking on an invite link. For a creator, we want that different links for different roles can be created and inactivation of links should be possible.",

      "description_html": "R provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques, and is highly extensible. R is often the tool of choice for research in statistical methodology.\n\nR is an integrated suite of software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It includes\n\n* an effective data handling and storage facility,\n* a suite of operators for calculations on arrays, in particular matrices,\n* a large, coherent, integrated collection of intermediate tools for data analysis,\n* graphical facilities for data analysis and display either on-screen or on hardcopy, and\n* a well-developed, simple and effective programming language which includes conditionals, loops, user-defined recursive functions and input and output facilities.\n\nThe term “environment” is intended to characterize it as a fully planned and coherent system, rather than an incremental accretion of very specific and inflexible tools, as is frequently the case with other data analysis software.\n\nR, like S, is designed around a true computer language, and it allows users to add additional functionality by defining new functions. Much of the system is itself written in the R dialect of S, which makes it easy for users to follow the algorithmic choices made. For computationally-intensive tasks, C, C++ and Fortran code can be linked and called at run time. Advanced users can write C code to manipulate R objects directly.\n\nMany users think of R as a statistics system. We prefer to think of it of an environment within which statistical techniques are implemented. R can be extended (easily) via packages. There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.\n\nR has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.",

It can be used to create/delete databases, import/export data from delimited files, view/edit data within tables, and query and search databases.\r\nThe usefulness of the package would be benefited greatly if some descriptive statistics and visualization tools are added. Such statistics and distinct types of plots would help in exploring data and allow users to detect patterns and irregularities that are commonly present in large datasets.\r\nThe idea of this project is to enhance the functionality of the existing RSQLiteAdmin tool and add functionality that could be used to explore the data and give a general idea of the information present in the data. These include implementing GUI tools to summarize the selected columns in the database, adding GUI ability to filter the rows based using different comparisons and operators, and adding the ability to add fully customizable plots and charts for selected columns.\r\nAll these features will greatly increase the ability of the RSQLiteAdmin tool and will allow users to get a general summary of the data through a friendly graphical interface without the need for writing code.\r\nThese explorations are not meant to offer detailed analysis but rather to help users in the initial steps of data visualization and/or data cleaning procedures.",

          "abstract_html": "Data Cleaning is one of the important and time-consuming steps in the Data Science and Data Analytics field. There are numerous methods, models, and algorithms for data cleaning processes that might be categorized under imputation, outlier detections, formatting, and visualizations among others. The process of evaluating these methods for a given dataset is challenging considering the volume of the dataset and the time/space complexities of the methods. Automation of the performance evaluation process can lead to a significant reduction in human efforts and time consumption with an unbiased comparison environment. \n\nThe imputeTestbench package provides a benchmarking tool for automated performance evaluation and comparison of various imputation methods for time-series datasets. In its present form, the package is capable of handling time-series and temporal datasets. Imputation plays a crucial role in the fields of genetics and genomics. The aforementioned package can be very helpful if it can be modified to handle genetic or genomics datasets. It has huge potential in handling genetic/ genomics datasets and introducing parallel-processing and high-performance computing concepts.\n\nConsidering these as a motivation, the goal of the project is to develop a new R package, modifying the imputeTestbench package for Genomics applications with better computational capabilities and will be named 'imputeTestbenchG'.",

We are senior professors at major research universities, senior developers in technology corporations. We also include junior professors, postdoctoral students, graduate students, undergraduate students, and even a few advanced high school students. Red Hen works in AI, Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.\n\nRed Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication.

The intention of knowledge graph is that it should help untutored eyes find connections between different artworks. This project is divided into 4 main parts:\n1) A model to find the parts of the image that might be useful to us and extract those regions of interest \n2) A classification model that would extract possible classes as well as items and use the confidence scores \n3) Defining an ontology that would be the skeleton for our knowledge graph. It would be able to tackle the problem of finding connections between separate artworks using the confidence scores found in the previous step \n4) Finally, we would populate our knowledge base with the help of our ontology.",

          "abstract_html": "Shot Boundary Detection of films is an important task that is mostly performed manually. There are some available tools and existing research which tend to automate the process. However, in the case of old archival films, available tools fail to detect most of the shot boundaries. State-of-the-art research performs quite well in detecting these boundaries, but these methods come with high time complexity and are not feasible to use in real life. In this work, an efficient and accurate shot boundary detection is proposed which should work well with archival films. The proposed tool will be built upon the existing work 'FilmEditDetection', which is developed during the last summer of code. The proposed tool should be able to detect the shot boundaries, which the previous tool fails to detect, without compromising the time complexity of the entire tool. This is achieved by using a machine learning-based framework on top of the cut detection module(Siamese Network). Few new features are also to be added to the tool - Average Shot Length, Comparison of individual shot lengths, etc. The current version of the tool is based on CLI. A graphical user interface can be developed based on the tool for simplicity of use.",

Art historians such as Emile Male have spent a significant amount of time describing this art.

Hence the goal of this project is to curate a dataset for tagging this arena of art. As a second direction, this project proposes\nthe use of a Multimodal Transformer to automate the process of tagging. While this would never replace the actual historian it still has possibilities in reducing the burden on actual professionals and helping out people who might not be well-versed with Christian Art.",

          "abstract_html": "This proposal proposes a multi-modal multi-phase pipeline to tackle television show segmentation on the Rosenthal videotape collection. The two-stage pipeline will begin with feature filtering using pre-trained classifiers and heuristic-based approaches. This stage will produce noisy title sequence segmented data containing audio, video, and possibly text. These extracted multimedia snippets will then be passed to the second pipeline stage. In the second stage, the extracted features from the multimedia snippets will be clustered using RNN-DBSCAN. Title sequence detection is possibly the most efficient path to high precision segmentation for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection (which have fairly structured recordings). This detection algorithm may not bode well for the more unstructured V8+ and V4 VCR tapes in the Rosenthal collection. Therefore the goal is to produce accurate video cuts and split metadata results for the first and second tiers of the Rosenthal collection.",

A single stream of data can contain multiple sound effects, so the model should be able to label them from a group of known sound effects like a Multi-label classification problem. The first step would be to develop a baseline model using existing pre-trained deep learning models and add to the Red Hen’s pipeline. Then the performance can be improved using transfer learning and fine tuning the existing model to achieve better accuracy. In this process, the models can be trained on sound effects from noisy or human labeled data sets after they are pre-processed to avoid acoustic domain mismatch problems.",

Expressing different concepts such as time, place, and emotion comes with speech and some movements called body gestures. In this study, we propose a multi-modal method that captures different patterns of body gestures aligned with an articulated time expression such as \"from beginning to end\". Our proposed architecture lies on two neural networks, the Compact Transformer and the Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM). Compact Transformer which is the current State-of-the-art structure for temporally distributed images also performs well over low-resourced data. LSTM performs well over temporal data with long-term dependencies. The hypothesis of this project is the existence of a relation between the body gestures and the time expressions we speak and using neural networks we try to accept or reject this hypothesis.",

The results from the previous algorithm are pretty similar to Paul's manually annotated spreadsheet shared by Tim. In my proposed approach, major problems with the algorithm can be solved, So I have decided to continue the show segmentation project. Some of the anchors are misinterpreted, leading us to the wrong show name. There are 2 ways to solve it by improving the boundary detection, thus improving the clustering algorithm, and using a cleaned MS-Celeb dataset. Combining both approaches will definitely enhance our boundary segmentation by up to 90%, resulting in final high accuracy in predicting show names and networks. We’ll try to finalize the segmentation project by this summer, and this should be the end of the past 5 years of quality research.",

During this project, we aspire to work upon the shot boundary detection problem which is of high importance for various other tasks such as movies retrieval, indexing and summarization. Our goal is to detect the transition between the consecutive shots and at the same time to identify the type of cut (e.g. gradual, abrupt). Compared to the majority of the existing works, we aim to work on historical films, with damaged or low-quality video data, which makes the cuts identification task particularly challenging. A large-scale dataset with historical films will be constructed with upper goal to reduce the required human effort, and then a multimodal deep learning network will be employed to perform fine-grained cut identification.",

This is then benchmarked against other fairness remediation techniques such as mindiff across the same indicators.\n\nFurther, documentation is created to ease understanding and use of FDW. This includes a text tutorial to be included on TensorFlow's Responsible AI site, and colab notebooks demonstrating how to use FDW on demo datasets.\n\nThe minimum deliverables are the insights gained by the experiments in the form of a report, and a set of documentation, both in the form of tutorials and colab code samples, showing how to use FDW. Optional additional deliverables may include changes to the FDW implementation itself or further integration into the TF ecosystem.",

The goal is to translate the playbook activity to be designed with users in a participatory design setting as hoped in the ACM Track 3 proposal. This is where interactive experiences on the website can add even more magic to what can be an even more powerful tool.  The goal is to turn one of the most essential, popular static activities as determined by the team and users into something interactive. This would include user research, heuristic evaluations, wireframing and designing UIs, and prototyping the product in code.

      "description_html": "RoboComp is an open-source Robotics framework providing the tools to create and modify software components that communicate through public interfaces. Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain-specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.",

Some early limitations arising from the necessary limited dimension of sensor spaces have been overcome with the integration of DNN as efficient reducers of large input data. In this project we want to apply RL as an online method to improve an existing grasping algorithm. Using a Kinova Gen3 arm simulated in CoppeliaSIm, that already performs a pick and place operation using a gripper with multiple force and distance sensors, the goal is to improve the current grasping performance by running RL algorithms that learn from the existing algorithm and, eventually, replace it to continue is adaptation to the specificities of the environment. If the experiments proceeds as expected, a second stage will try to transfer the learned controller to the grasping of a new target object in the scene, for example, from a block to a cup. All the experiments will be performed with RoboComp’s robotics cognitive architecture CORTEX, and the tools and existing agents already developed and tested.",

Starting in Android P, Android switched to using Google Conscrypt as the security provider. To be more consistent with Android, Robolectric should update the default security provider to Conscrypt.\n\nAs it is using the BouncyCastle, this means that whenever the JCA APIs are used in a Robolecetric test, BouncyCastle will be used by default. Officially, In Android the default JCE provider is Conscrypt. This is a Java wrapper over BoringSSL. The goal is to have Robolectric switch from BouncyCastle by default to Conscrypt.\n\nThe Conscrypt module uses BoringSSL, a native library that is a Google fork of OpenSSL and which is used in many Google products like Google Chrome for cryptography and TLS. \n \nConscrypt uses Java code and a native library to provide the Android TLS implementation as well as a large portion of Android cryptographic functionality such as key generators, ciphers, and message digests. Conscrypt is relatively selective and focuses on the most important and widely-used algorithms. \n\nConscrypt also supports the curves in Elliptic Curves crypto operations and it is much faster than BouncyCastle as it is optimized native code. But BoringSSL doesn't have official releases and makes no guarantees around API or ABI stability.",

But the current design is limited to a single bot operating on direct channels.\nThis decision was made due to privacy concerns of bots answering with sensitive data. This project aims to improve the functionality and usability without compromising privacy.\nThis project consists of allowing multiple bots to be connected and operating on various use cases (channels, omnichannels and direct). It also aims to improve the UI by correctly rendering rich components (bots with interactive graphical capabilities). By developing these features we can not only focus on extending the Botpress Connector, but also on making these extensions a good foundation for other bot connectors\n\n\n-Deliverables\n\nMultiple bots can be configured with the Botpress Connector\nThe Connector can inform which channels the bot is responding to\nThe bot can answer on omnichannel, channels and direct\nWhen handling sensitive data, bots will respond with a direct message\nRich components correctly render for the agent",

CAN protocol is a robust, reliable and multi-master serial communication protocol used to achieve real-time message transfer between devices within the CAN network. RTEMS being a real-time operating system, CAN peripheral support would increase the potential to meet real-time demands.\n\nBBB has two CAN 2.0 A, B (ISO 11898-1) controllers with 1 Mbps data transfer rate and DMA support. It also has inbuilt RAM which can hold 64 CAN messages. There is a loopback support also, which can be used for debugging purposes. By adding driver support for CAN modules, will enable the use of this potential hardware. With the help of the Am335x reference manual, TI’s starterware firmware and CAN specification I could understand the initialization and working of the CAN module. With the help of existing RTEMS supported CAN drivers I could understand the CAN framework and develop the support for CAN modules for BBB in RTEMS.\n\nI chose this project because I started learning embedded systems from BeagleBone Black and developed firmware from scratch with few peripherals and shell support https://github.com/slpp95prashanth/Beaglebone-mBootloader/tree/cpsw. As SoC and RTEMS are open source computing platforms, I would like to contribute to this project and learn more about RTEMS operating systems.",

The idea is to investigate the ways in which the GC can avoid interfering with objects belonging to Ractors that it is not working on, which would allow these Ractors to continue unhindered during Garbage Collection.\n\nThe final objective would be to have code for an improved version of Ruby's GC with measurable gains in efficiency.",

SageMath is a freely available open-source mathematical software system bundling the functionality of many software libraries, exposing their features in a common interface and extending on top of this with its own powerful algorithms. By leveraging the flexibility and universality of the underlying Python interpreter, SageMath is able to accommodate for a vast range of their requirements.\n\nThe mission of SageMath is to create a viable open-source alternative to all major proprietary mathematical software systems.\n\nPython is the main programming language inside the SageMath library and also the language of choice for all interactions with the built-in objects and functions for expressing mathematical concepts and calculations. Besides a command-line and programming-library interface, its primary user interface is a dynamic self-hosted website. From the perspective of a user, the interface language is Python, but with a thin extension built directly on top of it.\n\nAlmost all areas of mathematics are represented in SageMath, at various levels of sophistication. This includes symbolic calculus, 2D and 3D graphics, polynomials, graph theory, group theory, abstract algebra, combinatorics, cryptography, elliptic curves and modular forms, numerical mathematics, linear algebra and matrix calculations (over various rings), support for parallel computing, and a powerful coercion framework to “mix” elements from different sets for calculations. SageMath’s features also expand into neighboring fields like Statistics and Physics.",

Besides general purposes, improvements would also be considered with specific purposes, if provided, of piecewise linear function including but not limited to approximation, evaluation of definite integrals, and regression.

The traditional compilation is to compile Scala into Java Virtual Machine(JVM) bytecodes, which are executed by JVM. Scala Native compiles Scala into LLVM intermediate representation(LLVM IR) rather than JVM bytecodes. This property decreases the overhead of JVM and improves compilation performance. However, one of the most criticized aspects of Scala Native is its slow compilation efficiency and long build time, especially for large projects. Therefore, the optimization of Scala Native is urgently needed. The aim of this project is to build benchmarks to evaluate the performance of the Scala Native linker, and explore feasible solutions to accelerate the building task of Scala Native. Three aspects are going to be exploited: speeding up the optimizer, introducing incremental compilation, and changing the compilation and linking procedure. As a result, we expect to create benchmarks for evaluating the performance of Native Scala, and to reduce the build time by at least 20%.",

It is often time-consuming to figure out the root cause of such issues, and most importantly not all alerts and issues are important and do not need human interaction. This brings us to address the problem of out of box metrics, traces, events and logs collection for applications running inside Kubernetes, reporting all the collected data on a single dashboard and push notifications to users for critical ones. The collected metrics, traces, events and logs will help to debug the application running inside Kubernetes faster and effectively.",

Considering processing vast amounts of boundless stream data and doing a  less false positive detection rate is a system engineering challenge that should stand side by side with cybersecurity expert knowledge.  \n \nBuilding state of the art systems required several major components divisions. There are Data Sources (IDS, sys logs, net logs, firewall logs, files) , External intelligence (IOC, SIEM), Processing and detection unit(s)  (batch or streaming processing, deployed ML/DL models) , Data storages (databases, flat files, object storages) and visualizations (index, dashboards).\n \nRecreating each of above divisions are equivalent to reinventing the wheel, therefore openXDR focuses intergaterabiltiy to work with available tools out there which leads users to use existing systems without hassle but with the power of detection and response time of openXDR.

However, metaverse software currently on the market, from Second Life to Horizon Worlds, either limit input to traditional input devices like mice and keyboards, or require expensive gear in the form of VR headsets and specialized controllers. In this project we aim at integrating interaction techniques that rely on human facial and body gestures, similar to these employed in high-fidelity telepresence systems like Google’s Starline, that we will apply to a hybrid presence system and with low-cost hardware to enable accessibility and affordability. This GSoC project aims to perform much needed research into using face tracking as a viable means to improve the accessibility of 3D virtual spaces, much like those found in the metaverse. The result benefits all users, whether or not they have specific needs for accessibility: improved interaction vectors and empathy channels liberate all users. Face tracking software built upon open source technologies will be integrated with Satellite/Mozilla Hubs to provide this crucial feature, enabling a practical testbed for future innovation in hybrid telepresence interaction.",

It supports any kind of data stream: it has been used with multichannel audio, video frames, 3D models, OSC messages, and various others types of data. Shmdata is server-less, but requires applications to link data streams using socket path (e.g. \"/tmp/my-shmdata-stream\"). Shmdata is very fast and allows processes to access data streams without the need for extra copies.\n\nHowever, permissions are not supported, and any stream shared on the system with Shmdata is accessible system-wide. The project will enable the possibility for a Shmdata user to configure streams permission using shared memory right setting at the API level.\n\nWhen sharing data between processes via shared memory, not all components of the data need to be visible to everyone. Different groups might need to access different data, furthermore, some data might only be needed to be visible to the owner of the files. In such cases, the permissions that would have to be implemented are combinations of 'read', 'write' and 'execute' permissions that would be given to the owner, group or common user(i.e. everyone else).\n\nPermissions would be 'none', 'execute only', 'write only', 'write and execute', 'read only', 'read and execute', 'read and write', 'read, write and execute' with corresponding values of 0-7 respectively.\n\nDELIVERABLES\n\n* Providing an option for users to restrict or openly share data streams via these file/ directory access modes: read, write and execute/traverse.\n\n* Changing data access permissions.\n\n* Documentation for the improvements made.\n\n* Incorporation of ACL to assist with Unix file permissions.

The tools benefit users a lot and make their work easier, more efficient, and less stressful, but most of them need lengthy setups and installations, which are not very user-friendly. \n\nThis GSoC project attempts to integrate tools like SATIE and LivePose into a bespoke WebUI and make them accessible. The UI will be responsible for software configuration, deploying an  audio synthesizer on the back-end, etc. \n\nThe WebUI will be capable of deploying the tools (start/stop LivePose and SATIE, control Jack Audio parameters, and request reboot/service restart) and\nbasically remotely launching (and possibly integrating and mapping) SAT tools in embedded systems based on the Raspberry Pi generic computer running Linux. \n\nAny program or product's goal is to provide users with a rich and interactive experience; similarly, our WebUI will serve as an entry point to those tools with simple customizations that will make users' life much easier.\n\n\nDeliverables:\n 1. Create the Server ( Embedded system ) backend with the tools set up and operational.\n2. Create a backend for the WebUI.\n3. Connect both the backends with a suitable bridge.\n4. Develop the Frontend UI for launching and configuring the tools.",

GCC, Clang, MSVC, ICC all rely on different optimization passes in their backend and are all capable of auto-vectorizing certain loop patterns but not all.\n\nThe goal of this project is to analyze compiler codegen response to different hints and implement a version of the par_unseq and unseq execution policies in HPX that makes use of these guarantees to provide compilers with as many hints as possible to encourage auto-vectorization.",

But they have been missing coroutine (co_await) integration and minor functionalities as described in P2300 which is likely to be accepted. Hence I propose to implement these functionalities within the Core HPX Library.\n\nBenefits:\n* Coroutines introduce better async code. For example, it is more readable, local variables have the same lifespan as the coroutine which means we don’t need to worry about allocation/release.\n* S/R algorithms can work with coroutines which they cannot as of now unless relied on futures which as mentioned are single-time use.\n* Adding co_await support makes the code more structured with respect to concurrency which can also be done by library abstractions of callbacks but using co_await may make it more optimized.",

It is implemented using a type checker that breaks up the source code into subexpressions and generates their abstract type variables and type relationships to create a constraint system that maps out all of these components of the subexpressions of the source code and helps the compiler deduce the missing concrete type information from this context. These type variables, their interrelationships, and the final type-checked expressions can be printed as debug information to help compiler developers understand this process. However, the current debug output is hard to understand, wordy and repetitive, with a format that is difficult to follow. This proposal will reorganize and rewrite the debug output of the type inference algorithm to make it more human-friendly and improve the debugging experience for new and experienced Swift compiler developers.",

The two features that are planned to be implemented are solving Torsional problems due to the presence of torque along the direction of the shaft and calculating internal forces & reactions for a given Truss under external forces and moments. This project also plans to add some functions to the geometry module to add some flexibility to the way one can form composite shapes so that it is easier to define complex cross-sectional geometries for the beam module.

      "description_html": "Why syslog-ng?\n\n\nWith syslog-ng, you can collect logs from a wide range of sources, process them in near real-time and deliver them to a wide variety of destinations.\n\nsyslog-ng allows you to flexibly collect, parse, classify, and correlate logs from across your infrastructure (even from routers, embedded systems) and store or route them to log analysis tools.\n\nBy integrating with big data tools it is possible to deliver log messages to Kafka and Elasticsearch, even store logs in HDFS.\n\nsyslog-ng not only supports legacy BSD syslog (RFC3164) and the enhanced RFC5424 protocols but also JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and journald message formats.\n\nWorking with unstructured data? That's not a problem: syslog-ng comes with a set of built-in parsers, which you can combine to build very complex things.\n\nEven if you need to collect logs from a diverse range of sources, syslog-ng's PatternDB allows you to correlate events together and transform them into a unified format.\n\nIf you need to store your log messages in a database, you don't need to look any further! We have SQL (MySQL, PostgreSQL,Oracle), MongoDB. We also support inserting messages into Redis.\n\nsyslog-ng supports the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and the Simple Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP) too, with more in the pipeline.\n\nsyslog-ng supports sending messages to HTTP/REST services natively\n\nWant to deliver log messages to new systems, that are not supported by any of the log management systems, then you can easily integrate it with syslog-ng by a few lines of Python code implementing a new destination. Not only destinations could be implemented, but other items of the processing pipeline (e.g.: filter, parser, etc) and not only in Python language but also in Java.",

Through their explosive stellar death, supernovae enrich the Universe with new elements necessary for the formation of planets and life as we know it. From the iron in your blood to the silicon in your laptop, supernovae are responsible for producing many important elements from the primordial hydrogen and helium left over from the Big Bang.\n\nTARDIS provides a link between theory and observations: by creating synthetic spectra from theoretical assumptions and comparing these to observations, we can both interpret data and test models for why, when and how supernova explosions occur.\nWe, the community around TARDIS, are interested in combining astronomy, computer science, statistics and modern software design to build a tool that is useful both in research and teaching alike (with supporting documentation that would, in theory, allow anyone to recreate the project from scratch).

Each time there is a change in the codebase of Tardis, it is hard to run the projects and update the spectra manually. So a CI/CD framework should be created to automate comparing and publishing the results. To achieve this, we intend to use GitHub Actions.\r\nThe existing projects have different ways to run the simulations. So the existing projects will be modified to be integrated into the pipeline.

The key to decreasing mortality is developing more precise diagnostics. Keeping this in mind, this project attempts to develop a sophisticated diagnosing technique that will highlight the potential cancerous regions in a given ‘Prostate biopsy slide’, thereby aiding the doctors in faster and more accurate diagnosis. However, in the presence of a Subject Matter Expert (SME) (doctors, radiologists, etc.…) this task becomes trivial, but in the absence of SMEs diagnosing PCa via 'Whole Slide Images' is almost always impossible. In many developing countries, the healthcare sector is drastically underfunded and the vast majority of these countries cannot provide basic healthcare to the public. In such conditions, the availability of doctors is very unlikely. Automated analysis and classification of biopsy images without the presence of any subject matter expert is a crucial task. Thus, developing a reliable and robust system, susceptible to noise, in the form of a web app or inference engine is the project's main goal.",

MobileViT presents a different perspective for the global processing of information with transformers, i.e., transformers as convolutions. Our results show that MobileViT significantly outperforms CNN- and ViT-based networks across different tasks and datasets. On the ImageNet-1k dataset, MobileViT achieves top-1 accuracy of 78.4% with about 6 million parameters, which is 3.2% and 6.2% more accurate than MobileNetv3 (CNN-based) and DeIT (ViT-based) for a similar number of parameters.

Beginners can study the history and design ideas of object detection neural networks. \nThe result of this project consists of the creation of several new fine-tunable transfer-learning-friendly object detection models, a detailed tutorial for building and fine-tuning the model, and a brief guide on the impacts of hyperparameters and how to configure them.\n\nCheck out this Colab tutorial for keras faster-rcnn transfer learning:\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1-X9xcXYe2bYxichgomdY3FVN1Xap0Wui#scrollTo=Z_epOwYCf_4R\n\nCheck out this Colab for YoloV5 Transfer Learning:\nhttps://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XkHcer0xh_LvQPkqALJFv-5kPOcXnlF8",

          "abstract_html": "I will potentially work towards the following problems during the GSoC:\n\n1)  I am excited to implement advanced algorithms in JAX and create/re-produce demos/figures to put in textbooks. For example, recently I implemented Automatic Differentiation Variational Inference (ADVI) from scratch in JAX. Readers can easily connect maths with code by referring to this kind of from-scratch implementation. Also, pure JAX code can introduce some unique features of JAX such as  lax.scan() to optimize the training loop.\n\n2)  I will improve the quality of the existing figures in textbooks using a set of matplotlib configurations we use in our group for research papers. For example, In Figure 2.4 of book1, due to missing y-label, x-label, and legend, readers may find difficulty in understanding the figure. I will fill these small gaps and also improve the figure by applying latexify on them. Latexify is a function that applies latex effects by setting consistent font style, font size, and figure size with other text in the book.  For example, this gist (https://gist.github.com/karm-patel/9c5c2ee77afd495759ed1a2aad0e460e) shows an improvement of the above figure. I have already started to work on this thread and contributed by improving Figure 2.2, Figure 2.4, Figure 2.5, Figure 2.6, Figure 2.9, Figure 2.11, and Figure 2.15 of the book1. \n\n3) Add an Interactive demo for figures wherever applicable: I will add some interactive demos for figures so the reader can visualize the effect of variables in a particular problem. For example, figure 2.9  shows two different binomial distributions for two different θ (probability of success). I have added an interactive demo as shown in this notebook (https://colab.research.google.com/github/probml/pyprobml/blob/master/notebooks/book1/02/binom_dist_plot.ipynb) In above notebook readers can change θ and understand the effect of θ on the binomial distribution.",

          "abstract_html": "KerasNLP is a library for building NLP building blocks such as model layers, metrics, tokenizers, text processing/augmentation techniques, etc. I have contributed a few of these modules myself, and would like to contribute more such modules during GSoC. \n\nFirstly, I would like to contribute NLP-specific metrics. Here, I plan to implement metrics which are not present in Keras, and which are generally used for NLP tasks. Most of these metrics will be implemented as live training metrics, i.e., they can be input to `model.compile` and computed during training. Hence, the implementation should be \"in graph mode\". The metrics I wish to implement are: BLEU Score, Word Error Rate [WER], Character Error Rate [CER], CHRF, CHRF++ and BLEURT.\n\nSecondly, I wish to add functions for decoding strategies. Text Generation is an important problem in NLP. It encompasses tasks like summarisation, machine translation, story generation, etc. During inference, we need to sequentially decode the output of the encoder-decoder model. This is where these utility functions will help users. I plan to implement popular decoding strategies like Random Sampling, Greedy Sampling, Beam Search, top-k Sampling and top-p (nucleus) Sampling.\n\nI also want to add model encoder layers. KerasNLP does not aim to build complete models; it aims to build \"building blocks\" from which models can be built. Keeping this in mind, some encoder layers which I aim to implement are (these encoder layers can then be stacked up to form the complete model): Reformer and ConvBERT (or gMLP) encoder blocks.\n\n\nText augmentation means perturbing the samples in the original dataset to increase the size of the training set. This is where native text augmentation layers can be immensely useful. Backtranslation and Contextual Word Augmentation are methods which I will implement.\n\nThe above modules are explained in details in the proposal document.",

Sometimes collecting substantial amount of data is almost impossible/ extremely expensive as well incases of Low Resource Languages etc. hence Deep Learning Practitioners have moved to Data Augmentation Techniques to create synthetic data from real data. In Computer Vision the parallels are very clear for instance zooming in on an image or rotating an image retains labels in most cases however in Language wrong modifications can lead to mislabeling of data pretty quickly and hence it's much more trickier to perform Data Augmentation in these cases.\nThrough my proposal I would like to add 10 Data Augmentation Techniques most of which are Rule Based but have been used extensively in NLP literature to achieve substantial improvements. Having these Techniques as layers would make it convenient for users to add these techniques to their workflow and push models into training. Tweaking augmentations would also be less of a hassle as currently most Data Augmentation libraries don't offer seamless integration with models without writing custom code. \\\nThe 10 Techniques I plan to implement are Synonym Replacement, Random Deletion, Random Swaps, Random Insertion, Stop Word Dropout, Character Level Swap, Keyboard Typo, SentenceShuffle, Remove Duplicate Sentences and Back Translation\nAll of these techniques have been used in Heavily Cited Works making them the perfect candidates to add to the list.\nBy the end of the GSOC tenure my goal is to have these techniques fully implemented as layers with accompanying tutorials to get started with them for new users to quickly add these to their workflows once the library has a formal release.",

As an example, we created a video that demonstrates how simple machine learning and microprocessor peripheral optimisation can reduce the current consumption of the Wake Word detection model in the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller.

ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.\n\nUsers write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.\n\nThe compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.\n\nTo really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.",

As Tiled offers better room editing features than Game Maker, adding Tiled compatibility to Enigma can help users take advantage of Tiled room editor along with Enigma’s development environment. This project also expects some research to know the intermediate representation of Tiled in much more detail.\nTMX is a Tiled specific room format and EGM is an Enigma specific project format. Most of the features supported by EGM format are based on Game Maker’s format GMX. The way this project aims to achieve Tiled compatibility is twofold. First part consists of adding a TMX importer to Enigma while the second part consists of adding an EGM importer to Tiled. Additional tasks involve analyzing GMX 1.4 to understand various protocol buffer fields, adding Gtests in libEGM to check correctness of deserializer efficiently.",

This will allow bhyve to support debugging guest operating systems on AMD platforms, which \nwould facilitate kernel development for more 64-bit x86 hardware (other than Intel). \n\nThe second goal is adding support for hardware watchpoints (and optionally hardware breakpoints) using the guest OS's hardware debugging registers.  This will improve the kernel development workflow\n and allow easier and faster fixes for various kernel memory corruption bugs.",

The new HTTP/3 layer will be based upon mitmproxy's existing HTTP/2 layer.\n\nOnce the project is complete, QUIC and HTTP/3 traffic can be inspected using mitmproxy as well, just like HTTP/1+2 today.

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2023 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and National University of Singapore.\n\nJPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.\n\nJPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.",

In Java Symbolic Pathfinder (SPF), a widely used Java symbolic executor, existing string solving integration lacks support for many string functions, including some frequently used ones. To improve SPF string solving, I will implement support for unhandled string functions based on functions that are already supported. For some functions looping on the input string, I will construct solver constraints by symbolically executing the implementation of those functions. As stretch goals, I also plan to add support to StringBuilder/StringBuffer and implement regex solver integration.

For example, the Julia REPL requires additional packages to display images in the REPL and is inconvenient for repeated use. Images also clog the REPL, making it more inconvenient when pre-processing data. On the other hand, notebooks lack debugging tools and waste a lot of space in their layouts.\n\nA straightforward and extensible solution that uses the REPL and customizes it to our needs can bridge this feature and convenience gap. The TermLayouts.jl project aims to add extensions to the REPL and introduce a layout in which these extensions can be moved and resized to fit the user's needs. This layout can further be customized using a configuration file.\n\nThis project will also seek to provide some essential extensions which most users would like to have. These extensions include a variable inspector, a fully-fledged debugger, and a plot area for displaying images.\n\nAll the code will be thoroughly tested using unit tests and documented extensively for future ease of maintenance.",

As of now Javis does not store drawing information as a data-structure but a function at compute time. The Object is drawn to the canvas by a function call at render time.\n\nThe proposal has 3 parts.\nFirst - pre-compute the polygons/paths that an Object will place on the canvas, and have that information as a field in the Object. This part involves hacking into functions in Luxor.jl\nto store/return the information of drawn paths somewhere.\nSecond - Bring in the ability to partially draw an object with the above paths at hand. Also implement functions to animate the \"creation\" of the object being shown. For example\nif the Object were a circle , the creation animation would draw an arc increasing its angle from 0 to 2Pi .\nThird - Bring in the ability to morph an Object into another. For example turn a square into a circle. The current implementation of Morphing in Javis has certain limitations, with the proposal implemented any arbitrary Object would be morph-able into another Object",

A person who is only interested in running a Pluto Notebook and running Julia on it may or may not know how to do any of these steps, and since these can be automated, why keep this task to the end user? \nMy Plan to solve: This is where this app comes in, bundles all these steps, runs this in the background, and then only shows the user their notebook running inside the app itself, no browser required.\nDeliverable: An Electron app that can perform the following tasks: \n1. Install Julia and pluto on the first run. \n2. Show the pluto view inside the app. \n3. Allow the view to interact with the server. \n4. Support the native file system features of Pluto. \n5. Support running more than one instance of Pluto views. \n6. Support light and dark modes. \n7. Be responsive (allow different screen sizes). \n8. Show the Julia Package Page inside the app itself to refer to some documentation when and if required. \n9. It should also have proper comments and documentation for future reference.",

The hybrid variant (HDS) sits in the middle in terms of accuracy and speed between DS and FDS. Since demands for the two differ according to situation, it makes sense to implement all thre versions (DS, FDS, and HDS) so that everyone interested can use the one most suitable to their situation.

DFT finds an approximation of the Schrödinger equation corresponding to the studied system: this approximation comes to solving coupled non-linear partial differential equations. To deal with this method of simulation, the DFTK package is being developed in Julia.\nTo reduce runtime, we wish to develop the use of a local GPU to offload computations. However, the goal is to minimize the amount of code which needs to be adapted: having two different versions of the code existing at the same time (one for CPU and one for GPU) can be difficult to maintain in an open-source framework. This also makes the implementation of new algorithms difficult, and can deter newcomers from getting involved in the project. Since GPU algorithms for DFT already exist, the main challenge is to orchestrate the overall flow of data between CPU and GPU.\nWe believe expanding the DFTK package will showcase the possibilities the Julia programming language offers and bring together many different communities involved in molecular simulation.\nI aim to produce an alternate version of code of the DFTK package using GPU framework by clearly highlighting the differences with the CPU version and keeping code changes as low as possible.",

Consistent Structure The data for MLDatasets are sourced from different websites, who in turn use their own variable names and specifications. Currently MLDatasets does-not enforce any fixed api for data-access, so an end-user needs to refer to the docs for each dataset. Maintaining a fixed API for a dataset will make the repository more\nusable.\n4. Loading of Large models: Most of the modern day datasets does not fit into [personal] computer memory. The dataset needs to chunked before it can be loaded into memory. MLDatasets.jl currently lacks methods for chunking, so developing methods for loading large [Graph] Models in memory necessary.",

          "abstract_html": "Reachability analysis deals with uncertainty propagation in dynamical systems. Given an initial set, modeling the uncertainty on the initial state, it aims to answer the question \"What is the set containing all possible final states?\" This question is relevant in several domains such as safety-critical applications and systems verification. Traditional approaches have mainly concentrated to convex sets, which can lead to overestimation of the final state when this is actually non-convex (so-called wrapping effect). Recently, Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes (SPZ) have been introduced as a set representation for  both convex and non-convex sets. SPZ have been shown to have a compact representation that allows efficient manipulation.\nThe goal of this project is to implement Sparse Polynomial Zonotopes in LazySets.jl and the corresponding reachability algorithms in ReachabilityAnalysis.jl for the JuliaReach organization. The final result will be a state-of-the-art (SOTA) toolbox for reachability analysis with sparse polynomial zonotopes, together with systematic benchmarks comparing our Julia implementation both to different implementations of the same approach and other SOTA approaches in reachability analysis.",

These states are then periodically exchanged which helps in evading local minima. \n\nDuring the complete project phase, variants of REMD known as temperature-REMD and Hamiltonian-REMD were implemented. Along with these a general interface to define custom REMD simulations, improvements to the parallelization, more potentials and many improvements to the whole library in general were introduced.",

          "abstract_html": "Overall, the proposal is about adding a few missing features in the package, like addition of new models, some metaprogramming, lazy evaluation, testing, documentation and linting. \nCurrently, the package only supports four regression models (Linear, Logistic, Poisson and Negative Binomial regression). There is a huge scope of adding many more models to the package. To start with, we can add the Gamma and Inverse Gaussian regression models, and the ARIMA model for time series. Over time, more models can be added to the package.\nThere is also a scope of adding new macros to the package to make the syntax more clean. An example of this is in the fitmodel function of the package (and is explained via a code snippet in the proposal). From the documentation, it can also be seen that any model has many attributes which are computed when the fit function is called. When working on big data, it is possible that not all the attribute values are needed, so it is currently inefficient to compute every attribute. Instead, one can compute the attributes lazily, i.e as and when they are needed. Rigorous unit testing should be added to the package to ensure code correctness. Also, the package code can use a lot of help with its documentation and code coverage. All of these can be implemented using CI/CD. Finally, in its current state, the package lacks strict code conventions (like variable names, commit message rules etc). These are essential to ensure good quality code and to make the job easier for future contributors. To enforce this, linting can be added to the code along with Git hooks to enforce these conventions. Also, a well defined API should be documented for the models, so that new models can be added at ease.",

          "abstract_html": "The hardware necessary to build networks, sensors and computers of quantum nature is at its infancy. Potential quantum memories, repeaters, and switches are being researched all over the world, and the quantum hardware race has started.  Therefore, a need for efficient, functional, and accurate open-source quantum networking modelling tools has never been more imminent. Projects such as Julia’s QuantumClifford.jl enable researchers across the globe to research various aspects of quantum networking while anticipating the creation of the necessary hardware to produce laboratory experiments. They present cheap and efficient environments to start building potential switch, protocol, and network designs. \n\nIn classical computing, if one wants to protect a bit against errors, it can often suffice to represent that bit by a logical bit by repeating the data bit. Nevertheless, in a quantum setting, that type measurement is much more complex. Quantum qubit theory along with quantum noise present one of the most challenging problems that the quantum information field must overcome to become scalable and profitable: How to account for the error correction, needed due to quantum noise, in quantum gates?  \n\nSimulators, such as Julia's Clifford gate simulator, must mimic not only the behaviour of quantum noise, but also the effects of currently proposed quantum error correction codes. For this reason, this project proses a comprehensive library of frequently used quantum error correcting codes for Julia’s simulator of Quantum Clifford Circuits. These would include the Steane, Shor, and Toric codes, as well as other Surface and CSS quantum error correction codes.",

This is caused by the underlying Just-In-Time compilation, and the current solution is to build a user system image containing pre-loaded libraries with precompiled code. However, the workflow is primarily manual, and users are forced to recompile the system image after any package update. Currently, Julia's developers work on introducing system-image-like blobs containing compiled native code for a specific package. However, both these methods compile only package-specific precompile statements by default, and the project will introduce a new package to change this paradigm. The package would collect precompile statements during normal usage of Julia and offer to recompile the system image (or blobs) once the libraries are updated. The provided images would fit the specific user's needs and contain compiled code that would not be compiled by the default.",

          "abstract_html": "Print Dialogs are one of the most used features for many people, and it is important that they stay up to date with the current print technologies (like CUPS) and be able to quickly adopt any new such upcoming technology (XYZ Cloud Printing Service). The print technology developers should also be able to fix any bugs as soon as they are found. However, since most Print Dialogs are provided natively by the GUI toolkits (and in some cases applications like LibreOffice and Chrome), this is often not the case. This is because the GUI toolkits themselves are large projects with long release cycles, and they have a lot of other similarly important things to work on.\n\nAs of current, most GUI toolkits like GTK and QT connect their Print Dialogs directly with the print technologies like CUPS which creates problems for both. Any changes made by the print technologies, be it a bug fix or a new feature release often takes a long time to show up in the print dialogs upstream due to the reason mentioned before. Similarly, the print technologies need to constantly maintain backwards compatibility since they can’t release breaking changes if the Print Dialogs have not yet implemented them. Besides this, there is also a disconnect between the two sides due to the slow-release cycles.\n\nThe Common Print Dialog Backends (CPDB) introduced in 2017 by Till Kamppeter aims to de-couple the GUI from the print technologies. Instead of directly connecting to each print technologies separately, the GUI projects only must adopt CPDB support once, and then OpenPrinting (or any upcoming cloud printing projects) takes care of the CPD Backend for the print technologies to be up to date with any changes. This way print technologies can react quickly and not be bound by the big GUI toolkits’ inertia.\n\n\nThis project will attempt to get CPDB into print dialogs upstream for GTK, Qt and Chrome.",

Integrating an IAM with Payment-Hub will help balance security with efficiency, giving customers quick access to their finances while barring anyone else. As other digital technologies become increasingly agile, customers become more accustomed to speed, making these considerations more critical. Also, with the rise in remote access to the system, we must have a secure way to authenticate and authorize users. If every employee had access to all data, one breached account could spell disaster for an entire Financial Organization. IAM brings in the segmentation and privilege restriction aspects which is necessary as remote access expands. The agility benefits of segmentation and digital identities make IAM the ideal solution. \n\nGoal: \n\nIntegrating an Identity and Access Management system (Anubis/Keycloak) to Payment-Hub.\n\nProject Impact:\n\nCurrently, there is no Identity manager in Payment-Hub and users are authenticated only using basic auth. Integrating an IAM System(Keycloak) with Payment Hub will have the following major impacts:\n- Single Sign-On capability: There will be unique sign-on credentials for access to any system, network or service. Keycloak can be used to integrate this.\n- Multi-Factor Authentication: It will involve two or more forms of login credentials for information access.\n- Privileged Access Management: We would be able to bound users to a set of privileges/access. This will provide a secure way to monitor access control with more visibility. \n- Securing APIs: IAM system will also help secure APIs and API Keys.\n\nDeliverables: \n\nThe deliverables are divided into three main tasks, namely,\n- Token Introspection\n- Scope Check\n- OAuth MTLS",

It will allow for a Raspberry Pi running NetBSD to take advantage of the dedicated graphics processor, which could be useful for other programs which currently use software rasterization to utilize OpenGL ES. Specifically, the project will be compatible with Mesa as-is, allowing existing programs which depend on Mesa for graphics API support to be able to support the Raspberry Pi's GPU under NetBSD. This will be solved by porting the existing driver to be managed inside a NetBSD loadable kernel module, which can be loaded at runtime when needed. When complete, this will allow for OpenGL ES programs which have been ported to NetBSD from Linux, and already utilize the GPU under Linux to similarly use the GPU under NetBSD, such as programs which can render a triangle, a teapot, and some games.",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008.  The simulator is written in C++, with bindings for Python scripting, and uses the CMake build system.  We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists and Zulip chat, but typically not other social media.",

A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\n\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed.\n\nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\n\nSince 2019 we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also felt these organizations often faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities.\n\nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the open source software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site cloud hosted service as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills to do so independently. We hope that our contributors will help us achieve this goal.",

Currently, the documentation website is being powered by numerous Markdown files which are being rendered into a static website with the help of Docusaurus. \n\nThe challenge is to find and implement a way to generate documentation (in the form of static HTML files) from comments within the files, which can then be hosted on the site used for documentation.

This Foundation Code, developed by Intel as part of a project code named Tiano, was Intel’s “preferred implementation” of EFI. This evolved into EDK, EDK II, and other open source projects under the TianoCore community.\n\nThe EFI Specifications were contributed to the United EFI Forum as part of the original UEFI Specifications, which has been adopted by over 200 companies and shipped on billions of compute devices. The UEFI Forum does not endorse any particular implementation, but TianoCore is designed to implement the UEFI and UEFI PI specifications.",

However, it presently lacks support for S3 resume, an important feature for mobile platforms. This limits its applicability as-is regarding mainstream use. Therefore, I propose to develop S3 resume support for MinPlatform.\n\nHowever, the S3 resume path can be difficult to debug, like the early PEI phase in general. Since serial ports are commonly either difficult to access or entirely lacking in laptops, closed-chassis debugging options are desirable. While most interface protocols are unavailable until DMA is possible, HDMI offers I2C over the DDC pins. Therefore, I intend to develop support for a debug port over HDMI.",

Beginning in 2022, we took over the programmatic responsibilities of the UCSC Center for Research in Open Source Software (CROSS), including mentorship activities such as GSoC. Following in line with the earlier work of CROSS, the OSPO creates partnerships with stakeholders within and outside the UC system in order to help students learn from open source communities, support scientists in using open source to accelerate research efforts, and connect students and scientists with sponsors from industry, government, and foundations. The OSPO helps bridge the gap between academic research and successful open source projects by promoting innovative projects maintained by UC-affiliated scientists and researchers. We support the transfer of cutting-edge technology resulting from UC-originating research to industry via successful open source projects. Due to the multi-campus nature of our current efforts, the projects we support and promote cover a wide range of topics and technologies - including:\n\n- Open Source Hardware\n- AI / Machine Learning\n- Storage Systems and Devices\n- Data Management\n- Visualization\n- Performance analysis\n- Reproducibility\n- Cloud-based computation\nAll of our mentors are scientists and researchers who are actively involved in one or more of these open source projects.",

We first establish the logic schematic of the Register File and use multiplexer since we don't want to route all of the wires over the array, which would consume a lot of metals and be difficult to automate. For a tri-state multiplexer, we will use tristate for each D FlipFlop because this will use the same data line throughout the array of DFFs for easier and better routing.

The low-level interface is intended to be a complete wrapping of the HDF5 API.\nThe h5py package currently only supports synchronous I/O. And this project I am going to add the Asynchronous I/O.\n\nThe plan to solve it:\nMilestone 1: create a new Python API.\nMilestone 2: convert existing c tests to python tests.\nMilestone 3: test my implementation with the tests.\nMilestone 4: evaluate the performance with a scientific python application.\nWhen all tests pass we will have a usable Python interface for the asynchronous I/O.\n\nAn example: the H5Fcreate_async function:\nFirst, prepare the H5Fcreate_async.h file, H5Fcreate_async.c file, and we create the cyH5Fcreate_async.pyx file. \nSecond, use the command to Parse pyx source code into c code. \nNext, use some commands to compile c files into object files (*.o files)\nNext, use some commands to link multiple object files into dynamic link library files (*.so files)\nIn this way, the file of H5Fcreate_async.so is obtained, and then the library can be imported in the Python application.",

This will allow mentors in slack to have one go-to point for all of the most common issues that they can refer to.  \n\n\nAll of the tutorials and demos are text + screenshots posted on GitHub. This is because it’s easier to update them when new versions of software come out or if the existing guide does not cover a particular topic. Videos get outdated every 3-6 months and require an effort from contributors to support. The aim is to reduce the cost of documentation support.  \n\n\nAll documentation will be proposed to developers of the according to software to be integrated into existing software’s documentation.

          "abstract_html": "At the moment, Unikraft can leverage a single processor only. While there can be multiple threads (i.e., multiprogramming), no two activities actually run at the same time (i.e., multiprocessing). Unikraft introduces support for symmetric multiprocessing (SMP), thereby allowing it to execute code on all processors and cores of a system concurrently. This creates new challenges for synchronizing access to shared resources. On a single-processor machine synchronization primitives like mutexes and semaphores can consider interrupts as the only source of parallel execution. It is thus sufficient to protect a critical section of code by temporarily disabling interrupts. With SMP, however, this is no longer sufficient as other processors may access shared resources at any time.\nThe project will involve studying locking mechanisms used in modern kernels like Linux, FreeBSD, etc, improving the existing locking mechanisms in unikraft, and implementing new mechanisms such as read-write. The important part of the project will be identifying the critical sections present in the kernel and protecting these critical sections.",

Forward edge attacks (through function pointers and virtual calls) were proven to be less accessible after implementing Control-flow integrity (CFI) solutions. However, backward edge attacks easily bypass present instrumentation (Safe Stacks, canaries).\n\nUnder these circumstances, shadow stacks become more than necessary: shadow stacks are a defense mechanism that require metadata about the program’s state to enforce their policies. They protect the return value of the functions by comparing what’s pushed into them with what resides in the traditional stack, practically, functioning as a backup and check storage. \n\nMy project will consist of comparing different implementations of shadow stacks with their advantages and disadvantages, crafting a compelling PR, that would perfectly fit Unikraft's vision regarding modularization and portability and a clear discussion of the overhead brought by such an approach.",

However, there are also hints that this UI requires some additional work before the release and that this proposal could assist with.\n\nVLC on macOS, for example, does not quite look like other macOS applications yet, though it’s obvious that this is an objective of the Mac team. Navigation does not work the same way as other AppKit applications and is structured in an unconventional manner. Additionally, there are visual divergences from the Apple HIG. The proposal contains visual examples of this.\n\nThis proposal therefore seeks to assist in the redesign of the macOS UI for VLC by altering the aspects of the current implementation that clash with established human interface guidelines in macOS applications. Specifically, this proposal suggests:\n\n1. A redesign of the playlist to resemble collapsible sidebars used in other macOS applications (such as the Music app’s playlist sidebar)\n\n2. Changes to navigation elements within main views, such as the aforementioned double tab bar\n\n3. Attention to detail and ensuring visual polish (correct alignment of elements, proper use of separators and view coloration to distinguish between parts of the app\n\nLastly, the current nightly version of the VLC player lacks the ability to control playback, volume, etc. from the video reproduction window. A set of playback controls such as QuickTime’s, which are inconspicuous and relocatable, would be a great addition to VLC and would make the transition for QuickTime users seamless. There would still be opportunities here for VLC’s branding to come through, mainly with the use of accent colours.",

This project involves making a set of reusable utility functions for going through different types of StreamField structures and applying changes, as well as ready made high level functions for common use cases of StreamField related data migrations and a way to generate corresponding migration files.

For instance, family pictures are not meant to be uploaded to Commons. This state will be remembered even after restarting the app. Tapping \"Not for upload\" when all selected pictures are already marked as \"Not for upload\" has the opposite effect, a bit like pressing \"Italic\" twice in a text editor makes the selected text in Italic then normal.\n2. Switch to hide/unhide pictures that are either marked as \"Not for upload\" or have been uploaded already. Hiding them allows the contributor to more easily spot pictures they might want to upload.\n3. Currently, when selecting 3 pictures, they are numbered \"1\", \"2\", \"3\". Instead, please make all numbers always show the number of selected pictures, for instance, if 3 pictures are selected, they should all have the number \"3\", and be uploaded in the same order as their thumbnails are shown.\n4. Add a fast scrollbar (ideally a Bubble scroll showing the date at which the pictures shown were taken).\n\n5. UI when in full-screen mode -fullscreen starts when you long-press any picture in the custom picker\n\n5.1. Show a small overlay indicating whether the picture is selected or not, showing the number of selected pictures.\n5.2.

Otherwise, the knowledge base will dry out and be obsolete after a while.\n\n\nMy project's goal is to create an ecosystem that will consist of Web service interfaces to push data from different sources, s.t. researchers. The industry can easily integrate it into their systems and efficiently help to extend the Wikidata knowledge base.\n\n\nThe impact of this will be data donations will be possible directly via different sources. The process will become easier and less time-consuming for contributors. Hence, the quality and quantity of the open data offered by Wikidata will increase.\n\n\nI will later try to implement a recommendation engine that suggests agreeable facts to Wikidata editors that are likely to be in their area of expertise. Also, gamification features to show appreciation to Wikidata editors, e.g., a badge Web service allowing users to integrate their score/rank into their profiles on social networks. That will be encouraging for the editors.\n\n\nGoals\n\n(1) Implement Webservice interfaces for data donations, i.e., sets of approvable facts (which should also contain links to evidence, etc.)\n\n(2) Implement a recommendation engine that suggests agreeable facts to Wikidata editors that are likely to be in their area of expertise.\n\n(3) Extend the gamification features to show appreciation to Wikidata editors. Example: a badge Web service allowing users to integrate their score/rank into their profiles on social networks (e.g., on Wikidata’s user page, GitHub profile, Linkedin profile) to show their dedication and activate other users.\n\nImpact\n\n(1) Data donations are possible and at the same time, an efficient approval process is supported.\n\n(2) More fact ingestions with the help of the Wikimedia community.\n\n(3) Faster integration of new facts into Wikidata.",

X.org's technologies underpin much of today's computing environment, and expertise in it is in high demand worldwide.\n\nToday, as the result of more than 20 years of work by teams of leading open source developers, most of the graphical user interfaces for Unix and Linux systems rely on X.Org. On top of the X-Server-based systems, this includes Android- and ChromeOS-based devices, and Wayland-based systems (Sailfish OS, Gnome, ...). X.Org is responsible for the design of the X libraries which interface with application, the acceleration architectures used for graphics, and the graphics and input drivers. In particular, it has been at the center of the recent restructuring of the Linux graphics driver stack.\n\nCome help us make the future more open!",

It’s expected that there will be other people working with KUnit on DCN in parallel, so there will probably be some code review to be done as well.\nI will keep track of my weekly progress on my blog, reporting the challenges I will face and trying to create an introductory material that could help future newcomers.",

The AMDGPU driver is the largest one in the kernel, with the DML component being particularly nasty as it doesn't adhere to many of the codebase's standards.\n\nKUnit is a framework for performing unit tests in a manageable way, without requiring basically any setup at all, and that would be used for testing the files under the DML component.\n\nThus, my project encompasses (1) making patches for testing those files, as well as refactoring and documenting them. (2) Producing blog posts about my experiences with the community and the project, tutorials on what I learned, and explanations that are less technical than the proper documentation, so as to reach more people. (3) Generating proper coverage reports and documenting the process for doing so. (4) I also plan on contributing to KWorkflow and IGT GPU tools to some extent, so as to make the project, all around, more useful for the kernel's engineers and also integrable in their CI tools.\n\nPlease check out the X.Org official project page: https://www.x.org/wiki/AMDGPU2022/",

Since this integrations subsystem relies heavily on third-party information and communication, there is a lot of scope to strengthen and secure the sub-system through improvements such as validating incoming webhook data via improving type annotations and handling, verifying webhook signatures/integrity, and documenting missing/incomplete webhook functionality. This project would also include the addition of more integrations quickly and efficiently based on issues raised, to make Zulip more helpful to teams irrespective of the tools and applications they use. Another important aspect is improving the existing webhook event-filtering system and generating documentation for it appropriately.

The web application UI is on its way to embrace modern design language while maintaining its solid performance and professional bug-free environment.

I’ll be working on improving the UI/UX of the web application, implementing the redesign changes, making the CSS codebase maintainable and scalable, improving the Zulip settings and administrative pages, improving the accessibility, and working on improved markdown support. Besides this I’ll work on other high priority design, bug fixes and de-duplication issues, mainly in the front-end areas.",
