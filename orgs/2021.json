          "abstract_html": "<p>CalibrateSDR is designed to accurately determine the frequency offset of an SDR via an IQ recording sample. Cheaper SDRs use a low-quality crystal oscillator which usually has a large offset from the ideal frequency. Furthermore, that frequency offset will change as the dongle warms up or as the ambient temperature changes. The end result is that any signals received will not be at the correct frequency, and they would drift as the temperature changes. \nCalibrateSDR can be used with almost any SDR to determine the frequency offset. As of now, it uses the synchronization channel symbols from DAB+ digital audio stations to determine the offset. The primary focus of this project is to extend the applicability towards more signal standards, so as to make it helpful for the SDR community. As DAB+ is mainly used in Europe, Signal standards like GSM, LTE, NOAA-Weather Satellites, DVB-T (use their sync pulses within the data) can be used. Currently, it uses the pyrtlsdr package, which makes it work with RTL-SDR. Piping the API to work with other SDRs will also make the project have a wide range of applications in the SDR Community.</p>\n",

Differences in the output of the new shader and the original one can be caused by bugs in the driver. Thus, our task involves expanding the set of transformations by building sets of transformation classes and writing their corresponding tests and fuzzer passes.</p>\n<p>Our main task involves the WebGPU Shading Language, a new shading language featured by WebGPU. Since web browsers will have WebGPU, a secure implementation is crucial. To achieve a high test coverage, we use coverage-guided fuzzing. It uses program instrumentation to trace the code coverage reached by each input fed to a fuzz target. The information is then used to make informed decisions that maximize coverage, and thus increase the effectiveness of finding software bugs and security vulnerabilities. This project involves automatic fuzzing using LibFuzzer. Since LibFuzzer-based custom mutators mutate test cases in a domain-specific way, effective designing and implementing Tint-specific custom mutators are essential for this project to succeed.</p>\n",

I am going to enable deep linking and allow users to vote through the app itself. Adding a search bar to search elections is on my to-do list. Manually adding every voter and candidate can be hectic for a large list, so I plan to make it easier by importing these data from excel sheets. I will be adding more visualization techniques in Result Fragment and also export the result in excel format to external apps or share it as a png file.

But this language pair still lacks an open-source machine translation system. \nMy proposal is to fill this gap as much as possible during this GSoC2021 program. \nSince Uzbek and Kazakh languages from the same language family, they are closely related in terms of grammar, word order and similarity in vocabulary, so I will try to make a bidirectional translation, with a more focus on Kazakh -&gt; Uzbek side, as Uzbek is my native language and I possess very basic knowledge in Kazakh.</p>\n",

Although the vast majority of SOTA source separation algorithms are built using Python-based frameworks, PyTorch’s C++ torchscript API provides an elegant solution for deploying python models in C++ applications. In Audacity, this would introduce the opportunity for the user to choose from a collection of domain-specific pretrained models, each suited for a different task (e.g. speech or music).  Additionally, it would set the foundational code for future integration of deep models designed for different tasks, such as speech recognition and audio classification. The goal of this work is not only to integrate source separation algorithms into Audacity, but more importantly to lay the groundwork for an extensible suite of open-source, deep learning-based music information retrieval (MIR) tools hosted by the world’s most popular free and open-source audio editor.</p>\n",

The existing monitoring tools are tough to capture these events, even in their full potential which is obvious due to the learning curve, lack of a normal end-user based simplicity and missing out on some useful parameters.</p>\n<p>Bench-routes is a GUI-powered highly scalable monitoring tool that monitors system services, kernel information, application behaviour and performance of web applications and its routes (API). The design of the project enables it to monitor anything that can be converted to a time-series format that is ingestible by our querier. This increases flexibility and widens the scope of monitoring.</p>\n<p>Bench-routes also performs a series of networking algorithms and calculations to find the real-time state of routes in an application.</p>\n",

I believe it's more convenient for the project itself to manage these entities. Users usually have their passwords, and Casbin is not designed as a password container.

However, to allow for a large variety of endpoint types to integrate with Ceph, we are encountered with some inconvenience on these various protocols from different service infrastructure. The workaround for the notification brings the burden of adaptor deployment, communication and translation overhead.AMQP 1.0 is the latest standard for AMQP. It focuses on core features which are necessary for interoperability at Internet scale, and it contains less explicit routing than previous versions. Even though Ceph has supported the AMQP(ver 0.9.1) natively, the gap between these two protocol specifications cannot be ignored. The next level AMQP(ver 1.0) requires a completely different client library.  AMQP 1.0 brokers are supported by Apache Qpid/ActiveMQ project and Azure platform, etc. To address this problem, we should support the AMQP 1.0 natively in the Ceph Rados Gateway. This requires adding the qpid-proton client library to the Rados Gateway code base, and use it to send notifications to AMQP 1.0 compatible brokers.</p>\n",

The <a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">HEP Software Foundation</a> facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://home.cern\" target=\"_blank\">CERN</a> (European Organization for Nuclear Research) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful <a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">particle accelerator</a> try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management, and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

CMS Software (CMSSW) is the framework utilized by the CMS experiment for Data Acquisition, Trigger and Event Reconstruction. The future upgrade of the LHC will add new challenges for CMS detector due to the larger amount of data that will be produced. \nOne solution is to look towards a heterogeneous High-Level Trigger (HLT) Computing Farm, where the computing load can be distributed among different hardware (CPU, GPU, FPGAS). This project aims to use Portability Libraries like Alpaka to write code for the CMS Software (CMSSW), in order to have a single implementation which will be compiled on different architectures. \nIn the last years, a new pixel track reconstruction that can run on GPUs (CUDA) has been implemented. The goals are to port the current CUDA implementation with Alpaka, in order to understand if this library is feasible for CMSSW and to compare the timing performances between Alpaka implementation and native CUDA.</p>\n",

Hence, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC uses a trigger system, which selects and transfers interesting events to the data storage system. However, if those events are buried in large backgrounds and difficult to identify as a signal by the trigger system, they will also be discarded together with the background. To alleviate this problem, various compression algorithms are proposed to reduce the size of the data that is recorded. One of those algorithms is an autoencoder (AE) network that tries to implement an approximation to the identity, f(x) = x. Its goal is to create a lower-dimensional representation of the input data in a latent space. Then using this latent representation the model can reconstruct its input. Moreover, two advanced families of AEs are proposed, the Variational and the Adversarial AE. Next, various combinations of different compression algorithms are tested to compress and construct accurate representations of the input data. Finally, the studied AEs are implemented for anomaly detection.</p>\n",

Unhealthy projects can have negative impacts for the community involved in the project as well as organizations that rely on such projects. In response, people want to know more about the open source projects they are engaged with. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open source contributors want to know where they should place their efforts and know that they are making an impact.</li>\n<li>Open source communities want to attract new members, ensure consistent quality, and reward valuable members.</li>\n<li>Open source companies want to know which communities to engage with, communicate the impact the organization has on the community, and evaluate the work of their employees within open source.</li>\n<li>Open source foundations want to identify and respond to community needs, evaluate the impact of their work, and promote communities.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In response to these issues, the CHAOSS project develops metrics, practices, and software for making open source project health more understandable. By building measures of open source project health, CHAOSS seeks to improve the transparency and actionability of open source project health so that relevant stakeholders can make more informed decisions about open source project engagement.</p>\n<h3>What are CHAOSS Goals?</h3>\n<p>The project goals are to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Establish standard implementation-agnostic metrics for measuring community health</li>\n<li>Produce integrated open source software for analyzing software community development</li>\n<li>Develop programs for the deployment of metrics not attainable through online trace data</li>\n<li>Build reproducible project health reports</li>\n</ul>\n",

Chapel is implemented with portability in mind, permitting\nChapel to run on multicore desktops and laptops, commodity clusters, and the\ncloud, in addition to the high-end supercomputers for which it was designed.\nChapel's design and development are being led by HPE in collaboration\nwith academia, computing centers, and industry. Chapel offers a unique\nexperience for students to work on projects involving high-performance\ncomputing, parallel programming, and compiler development.</p>\n<h3>Core features</h3>\n<p><strong>Native Parallelism</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports parallelism at the language level. For instance, Chapel\nprovides a \"coforall\" loop, which is similar to a \"for\" loop and creates a\nseparate task per iteration of the loop body. These explicit parallelism\nfeatures make it easier to reason about the parallelism in your algorithm and\nprogram.</p>\n<p><strong>Data and Task Locality</strong></p>\n<p>When working on a large machine, the location of some data relative to the task\nwhich uses it or other data with which it must work plays a key role in\nperformance. Chapel provides features which allow you to control that\nplacement, both within a data structure and outside it.</p>\n<p><strong>Multiresolution Philosophy</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel is designed around a multiresolution philosophy, permitting users to\ninitially write very abstract code and then incrementally add more detail until\nthey are as close to the machine as their needs require.</p>\n<p><strong>Modern Language Features</strong></p>\n<p>Chapel supports code reuse and rapid prototyping via object-oriented design,\ntype inference, and features for generic programming.</p>\n<p><strong>Interoperability</strong></p>\n<p>Existing code from other languages can be integrated into Chapel programs (or\nvice-versa) via interoperability features.</p>\n",

In addition, Cilium is a CNI plugin for Kubernetes.\nCilium can manage network access control by using network policy functions, called “CiliumNetworkPolicy” (CNP). Users can allow or deny specific traffic by applying a CNP. However, currently, any traffic except for TCP/UDP (including ICMP) is denied if an L4 CNP is present, and there is no way for the user to explicitly allow ICMP traffic. Therefore, I propose to implement a CNP for explicitly allowing ICMP traffic.</p>\n",

The description is used in clustering similar circuits together and then the views and stars (by choosing some weights) would be used to re-rank within a cluster.\nFeature extraction is done using the TF-IDF encoding and a text embedding is made on which a suitable clustering algorithm would be used in order to group similar circuits together and sent for re-ranking.\nA content boosted approach can also be used while re-ranking and using a similarity measure while displaying the circuits to users in real-time.\nThe project later focuses on integration with the Circuit Verse website by helping with the UI of the recommendation system.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>CloudCV is an open-source cloud platform led by graduate students and faculty at the Machine Learning and Perception Lab at Georgia Tech, with the aim of building tools for reproducible and accessible AI research and development. At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>We are building a platform called <strong>EvalAI</strong> as a scalable solution for the research community to fulfill the critical need for evaluating machine learning models. This will help researchers, students, and data scientists to create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges organized around the globe. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking these models, we seek to lower the barrier to entry for participating in the global scientific effort to push the frontiers of machine learning and artificial intelligence, thereby increasing the rate of measurable progress in this domain.</p>\n<p>The platform is used by more than 25 organizations from industry and academia such as Facebook, eBay, IBM, Stanford, MIT, Georgia Tech, etc. It has hosted 90+ AI challenges with 9500+ users who have created 100k+ submissions. It has more than 120+ open-source contributors and 1.3M+ page views since its launch in 2017. Several research organizations like Mapiallary research, IBM research, etc. are using its forked version for hosting their internal challenges instead of reinventing the wheel.</p>\n",

As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

This information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A KG is a database that stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. \nThe current DBpedia release 2021-01 consists of 21 billion triples (“facts”) and ~750 different “types”. The whole extraction includes 125 languages. It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata). Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first open KGs on the Web. Its knowledge base has several advantages over existing ones: it covers many domains; it represents real community agreement; it automatically evolves as Wikipedia changes, and it is truly multilingual. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia every day. \nDBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (such as SPARQL).\nHave you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That is the kind of query we are talking about.\nDBpedia has become a high-impact, high-visibility project because of our foundation in excellent Knowledge Engineering as the pivot point between scientific methods, innovation and industrial-grade output. The drivers behind DBpedia are 6 out of the TOP 10 Most Influential Scholars in Knowledge Engineering and the C-level executives of our members.</p>\n",

Our task then is to extract the cause-effect entity pairs (e.g., Peaceful_Revolution, German_reunification) from the wikipedia text. We combine the idea of using the seed data (e.g., the known cause-effect entity pairs) with training a classifier (e.g., a discriminative model--- LSTM ), so as to discover more cause-effect entity pairs from wikipedia text, which is known as distant supervised relation extraction. The procedures include the pattern matching, knowledge exploration, entity recognition, entity mapping, etc. Eventually, we aim to acquire more reliable causal relations between entities of DBpedia.</p>\n",

These tools are also free.</p>\n<p>Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what\nthey want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing\nmore software. Debian comes with over 59000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled\nup in a nice format for easy installation on your machine), a package manager (APT), and other\nutilities that make it possible to manage thousands of packages on thousands of computers as\neasily as installing a single application.

And in doing so help advance our understanding of disease and treatment, and also develop useful software and applications. Members of the department work in a variety of areas that range from machine learning, healthcare middleware that leverages cloud computing, clinical information systems, clinically oriented image analysis, and biomedical knowledge modeling. The driving applications for the various ongoing projects include cancer research, organ transplant, HIV, medical imaging, radiation therapy, and clinical data analytics. All development work that is undertaken is free and open-source.\nWe have had a diverse set of successful GSoC projects in the past. In previous years, GSoC students have worked on diverse projects such as: geospatial systems for exploring microscopy environments that leveraged Hadoop; GPU accelerated pipelines for computational analysis of digitized biopsies; interactive visualization platforms for viewing massive images (&gt;1GB); systems for data agnostic sharing of biomedical research datasets; Apache Drill based data integration and de-duplication platform for SQL and NoSQL databases; CNN based high throughput analysis of digitized biopsies; A GUI for Tensorflow; integrated architectures for biomedical data integration and federation; and information visualization of heterogeneous medical data.

OONI develops the open source software OONI Probe which provides tools for measuring internet censorship. QUIC is an emerging transport protocol that was initially designed by Google to solve problems with the existing TCP/TLS architecture. With increasing traffic volumes, it is significant to observe and measure QUIC blocking.<br>\nI want to identify and resolve existing inconsistencies with the QUIC code that I have contributed earlier this year.<br>\nEventually, the QUIC code should get to a point where it can be used in production by the Desktop client. Therefore, the first deliverable of my GSoC project will be to integrate QUIC support into the OONI Web Connectivity experiment.<br>\nThe second part of my project will be to implement the capability to parrot the TLS fingerprints of popular web browsers. TLS fingerprinting is a censorship method which identifies browsers based on the structure of the TLS ClientHello message. The ability of parroting TLS fingerprints will enable OONI Probe to measure and circumvent TLS fingerprinting.</p>\n",

Fortran-lang's flagship projects are the Fortran Standard Library (stdlib, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/stdlib</a>), Fortran Package Manager (fpm, <a href=\"https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/fortran-lang/fpm</a>), and the Fortran website (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.org</a>). In only 14 months, stdlib has had &gt;140 pull requests merged from 23 contributors, with a total of 43 new procedures and types over 11 modules, and continues to grow. Largely modeled after Rust's Cargo, fpm is a build system and package manager dedicated to Fortran with the key goal to improve programmer happiness. Fpm is already capable of building complex Fortran projects, automatically fetching and building dependencies, and bootstrapping itself. The Fortran website provides all the latest information about Fortran compilers, libraries, and community, as well as an actively developed tutorial. Fortran-lang issues monthly newsletters that detail the relevant news and updates to the projects, and distributes them on Twitter and on its mailing list. Finally, the Fortran Discourse (<a href=\"https://fortran-lang.discourse.group\" target=\"_blank\">https://fortran-lang.discourse.group</a>) is a moderated and inclusive online forum for discussion and collaboration, which, since May 2020, has attracted 146 active users from all over the world.</p>\n",

A deferred length variable is either <code>pointer</code> or <code>allocatable</code>. Compiler during execution allocates space based upon the value to be assigned to a variable.<br>\n<em>For eg:</em> If the value to be assigned to a character variable is <code>\"spiderman\"</code>, then the compiler will automatically allocate a space required to store this character sequence of length 9 and a reference to this space will be stored in the variable. Similarly, if a new character sequence, let’s say, <code>\"batman\"</code>(which is of length 6) is assigned to this same variable then the compiler will allocate a space required to store <code>\"batman\"</code> and a reference to this space will overwrite the previously stored reference in the variable. Thus, space required by the variable is constant as it is not storing the actual character sequence and is rather storing the reference to the space where the character sequence is actually stored.</p>\n<p><em>Goals of the project:</em><br>\n1).

Atarashi license scanner implements multiple text statistics and information retrieval algorithms. \nScanCode Toolkit is a very established license scanner similar to Nomos or Monk. It is a simple python based command line scanner that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It implements a number of different approaches and integrates these into one application for identifying and classifying license relevant content in packages.\nThe basic idea is to use the command line interface from the ScanCode package in order to be called right from the FOSSology application. FOSSology will pass a single file and take the result from the ScanCode command line call. Scan result will include license name, the SPDX key, Score, Copyright and Holder name, Emails and Urls present in the given code and as per requested by the user.</p>\n",

It is also the Brazilian branch of the <a href=\"https://globalframenet.org\" target=\"_blank\">Global FrameNet</a> initiative, an international effort to build language resources based on Frame Semantics and Construction Grammar started with <a href=\"https://framenet.icsi.berkeley.edu\" target=\"_blank\">Berkeley FrameNet</a> in 1997 by Charles Fillmore, in the International Computer Science Institute, in Berkeley California. FN-Br builds lexical and grammatical language resources and apply them to address issues in Natural Language Understanding. Frame Semantics takes a cognitive approach to study the meaning of words and expressions. Instead of using formal logics (a common view in computational semantics field), the meaning is structured considering how the language users understand and use the words in a given context. FrameNet is the computational implementation of this idea, building a lexical resource cognitively motivated.</p>\n<h4>The Database</h4>\n<p>FN-Br implements a relational database storing a set of frames - or scenes -, the elements structuring these frames, the language specific material (words, MWEs and grammatical constructions), and several typed relations between all those items. Such a database provides a model and a structure for semantic representation of the knowledge about a given language. Currently, FN-Br includes <a href=\"http://www.ufjf.br/framenetbr-eng/data/\" target=\"_blank\">data</a> about Brazilian Portuguese, English and Spanish.</p>\n<h4>The Applications</h4>\n<p>FN-Br database is the base for the development of different software: a frame-based multimodal web annotation tool, a domain-specific dictionary - the FrameNet Brasil World Cup Dictionary; a system for recommending tourist attractions - m.knob; a semantically enhanced sentence translator and a constructional parser - CARMA.</p>\n",

These types of simulations are a necessary step in any hardware design. It is intrinsically a hard problem, and even commercial simulators run slow compared to the real hardware, which can be several orders of magnitude faster. On the open-source side, Verilator is one of the most famous players and offers a competitive simulation speed time compared to the closed-source ones. We will base our work on this tool. \nThis project will consider that modern processors rely on Network-On-Chip (NoC) to communicate several cores in the same chip. The idea would be to use this hardware partition into consideration and make a stand-alone simulation per core and communicate through OpenMPI. This could potentially enable the simulation of a 1000-core processor, something currently unmanageable.</p>\n",

With sweeply increasing computing speed, instructions might spend much of their time in waiting queues during read-store access. Nevertheless, there are also many available OS and microarchitecture designs for solving this performance complication. One of the important is the multi-level Translation Lookahead Buffer(TLB) Implementation. Based on the cache locality principle, it aids to keep the frequently used address translations near the core, hence amortizes the waiting time for instruction fetching and load-store units. With many levels in place, the less is the frequency of misses, the better is the performance. Thus, this proposal will aim to enhance the current TLB structure of the CVA6 (Ariane) core to a multi-level with L2 TLB on top of the existing L1 TLBs.</p>\n<p>Here, CVA6 is the application class and Linux bootable 64-bit RISC-V 1.7GHz CPU Core.

FreeBSD provides advanced networking, impressive security features, and world class performance, and is used by some of the world's busiest web sites and most pervasive embedded networking and storage devices. From providing the foundation to the PlayStation 5 operating system, to Juniper's routers making up the backbone of the Internet, to being at the core of Apple's OSX and powering the servers Netflix use to stream terabits of video every second, chances are you are using FreeBSD right now without even realizing it.</p>\n<p>The FreeBSD Project began 28 years ago in 1993, but is based on the work of Berkeley CSRG with a history going back to 1978. Over those years the code base has gone through continuous development, improvement, and optimization. The FreeBSD Project is a large, mature, and yet relatively tightly knit organization, developed and maintained by a large team of individuals.</p>\n<p>There are currently over 300 developers with write access to the main revision control system, and hundreds more with access to our Subversion servers for experimental and third party development. This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

The freifunk operating system is based on the OpenWrt Linux distribution for embedded devices. Additionally, the distribution contains several extensions for wireless mesh networking. Our local communities contribute to a wide range of different software projects focusing on ad-hoc software services, routing and network protocols, monitoring systems and visualization solutions. For instance, actively developed packages by the community networks are mesh routing protocols like OLSR, BATMAN and Babel. Moreover, our developers contribute to new hardware support and drivers, distributed network monitoring tools and efficient user interfaces for network configurations.</p>\n<h4>Common goals</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Educate and create awareness on the subject of communication and freedom of information</li>\n<li>Reduce the digital divide with DIY broadband networks</li>\n<li>Unhindered distribution of knowledge and resources</li>\n<li>Empower people to plan, build and operate their own networks</li>\n<li>Promote and support existing and new social structures</li>\n<li>Overcome the vendor-lock-in effect</li>\n<li>Organize a community of many: decentralized structures are challenging in a positive way, e.g., to share information about communities, software repositories, working together efficiently but distributed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The software developed by community networks forms the basis for a wide range of solutions providing internet access.

It does not expose data or information of the user, even the IPs of the peers present in the mesh are not known, they communicate via routers and the entire communication is end-to-end encrypted between the users, thereby increasing privacy in user data.\nAs of now, Irdest supports various functionalities to users like sharing files over the network created, call between users, and messaging.</p>\n<p>This summer I plan to package and implement some of these core functionalities in an android application. The project aims at first building the FFI layer for interaction between the rust lib and android, a strong, robust &amp; unbreakable CI with cross-compilation enabled, and then implementing the features required.\nThe final product/deliverable of this project will be an android application that'll support the features which are provided by Irdest in the upstream, and a robust plus <em>modern</em> application codebase.</p>\n",

The current focus of GeomScale is scalable algorithms for sampling from high-dimensional distributions, integration, convex optimization, and their applications. One of our ambitions is to fill the gap between theory and practice by turning state-of-the-art theoretical tools in geometry and optimization to state-of-the-art implementations. We believe that towards this goal, we will deliver various innovative solutions in a variety of application fields, like finance, computational biology, and statistics that will extend the limits of contemporary computational tools. GeomScale aims in serving as a building block for an international, interdisciplinary, and open community in high dimensional geometrical and statistical computing. The main development is currently performed in volesti, a generic open source C++ library, with R and (limited) Python interfaces, for high-dimensional sampling, volume approximation, and copula estimation for financial modelling.</p>\n<p>In particular, the current implementation scales up to hundred or thousand dimensions, depending on the problem. It is the most efficient software package for sampling and volume computation to date with orders of magnitude performance in several cases compared to packages that solves the same problems. It can be used to compute challenging multivariate integrals and to approximate optimal solutions in optimization problems. It has already found important applications in systems biology by analyzing large metabolic networks (e.g. the latest human network) and in FinTech by detecting shock events and by evaluating portfolios performance in stock markets with thousands of assets. Other application areas include AI and in particular approximate weighted model integration, and data-driven power systems in control.</p>\n",

It is an important problem with various applications in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, for example in partial-order plans and in learning graphical models. It is a well known #P-complete problem; the fastest known algorithms are based on dynamic programming and require exponential time and space. Nevertheless, if we only need an approximate counting attained with a probability of success, then the problem admits a polynomial-time solution for all posets using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. This project aims to implement new randomized methods to approximate the number of linear extensions based on volume approximation.</p>\n",

Through our initiatives we aspire to contribute and coordinate the efforts of groups of volunteers, public servants, university researchers and students enabling them to form the backbone of Greek FOSS development and implementation. GFOSS is one of the strategic actors for the promotion of OSS throughout Greece (see <a href=\"https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">https://joinup.ec.europa.eu/sites/default/files/inline-files/OSS%20Country%20Intelligence%20Report_GR.pdf</a> ). Many public administrations and academic institutions collaborate with GFOSS to implement open source projects and through Google Summer of Code we give the opportunity to students to actively engage in the production and the actual implementation of an open source project. GFOSS also contributes and advices on the development of various open source projects related to e-government and digital transformation in Greece (e,g. <a href=\"https://howto.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://howto.gov.gr/</a> - <a href=\"https://forma.gov.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://forma.gov.gr/</a>) and actively promotes the use of Open Source software and hardware in the Greek primary and secondary education through the Open Educational Technologies Competition (<a href=\"https://openedtech.ellak.gr/\" target=\"_blank\">https://openedtech.ellak.gr/</a> )</p>\n",

There are also POSIX to Windows path conversion issues.</li>\n<li>No direct access to plumbing: Shell commands do not have direct access to the low level Git API, and a separate shell is spawned to just to carry out their operations.</li>\n<li>Performance: Shell scripts tend to create a lot of child processes which slows down the functioning of these commands, especially with large repositories.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The goal of this project is to complete the conversion of the remaining parts of <code>git submodule</code> to C, namely, the <code>add</code> and <code>update</code> commands.

      "description_html": "<p>GNSS-SDR is an open source Global Navigation Satellite Systems software receiver, written in C++, that is able to work either from raw signal samples stored in a file, or in real-time with a radio-frequency front-end as signal source, and performs all the signal processing until the observable computation and Position-Velocity-Time solution. Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

The behavior of the electromagnetic wave is closely dependent on the material in which it propagates. Some dispersive media have quite complex electromagnetic properties depending on the wavelength. This, for example, means that for different frequencies the wave can propagate with a different speed in different materials. This significantly affects the solver’s output. The main goal of the project is to enhance series of scripts, which modelled electromagnetic properties of the variety range of materials. Initial series of scripts have been prepared, however, their technical improvement and coupling with main software gprMax is required.</p>\n",

It provides a concise syntax and powerful code optimizations to achieve both ease of use and high performance. It also provides automatic gradient generation features for machine learning and optimization applications. Halide is used for code generation for several commercial applications including Youtube, Google Pixel, and Adobe Photoshop.</p>\n<p>The central idea of Halide is to decouple the algorithm (\"what\" we want to compute) and schedule (\"how\" are we going to compute it). The algorithm defines the high-level semantics of the program, and the schedule defines the lower-level computation details such as parallelism, order, or storage. The users would define the two separately and explore different ways to accelerate an algorithm. By following this philosophy, we have been able to generate fast Fourier transform code that is faster than fftw, and depthwise separable convolution code that is faster than TensorFlow.</p>\n<p>See Alex Reinking's cppcon talk for an introduction to Halide: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ir_nEfKQ7A</a></p>\n",

Its compiler internally uses a Term Rewriting System (TRS) in order to simplify complex expressions, which comprises over a thousand handwritten rewrite rules added by human compiler engineers. In order to strengthen the TRS by finding new rules that can rewrite input expressions that the TRS currently fails to simplify, a synthesizer was used to automatically generate 4127 verifiably sound rules. Experiments have shown that adding these rules lowers peak memory usage by up to 50%, while having relatively insignificant impact on runtime performance. However, adding every such rule increases compile-time and compiler code size. This project aims to address this problem by incrementally testing and assessing each rule and subsets of the rules, while adding them to the compiler only if they necessarily contribute to the peak memory reductions shown in the experiment or other improvements in performance.</p>\n",

The typed version not only helps with debugging and maintainability but also offers better support for type-driven development via GHC features like type holes. However, it is currently difficult to mix the two approaches, e.g., statically specifying tensor’s embedding size while keeping other dimensions unchecked is not possible. Gradual typing is the proposed solution that fuses the two APIs by adding Torch.GraduallyTyped type. The new API allows for more granular control by letting the user choose which properties of the tensor should be given a static type. The goal of the project is to bring maturity to the gradually typed tensor API, add missing features, and experiment with new ideas.</p>\n",

The flagship server hydrus can only serve static data and does not provide a way to define custom server-side logic. A new feature for dynamic endpoint could be added so that a developer would be able to define logic/functions  for how the incoming data is processed on the server end. A lot of improvements are possible in CRUD operations of hydrus, including setting up constraints and handling errors on the server-side depending upon how the data is stored in a Collection.

Although developed for MRI originally, it has gained popularity within the EEG and MEG realms. Converting raw data to the BIDS standard is not difficult but requires a lot of time if done by hand. Currently software like mne-bids and Biscuit are available to assist and facilitate this conversion but there is still no automated way to produce a valid BIDS dataset for the EEG and MEG use-cases. Mostly what is missing is metadata. Here a python package is proposed to be able to infer the missing information from files accompanying the EEG and MEG files and/or a single bids-conversion example provided by the user. The idea of having human-readable configuration files is also explored since this would help the sharing of common conversion parameters within similar communities. If this proposal was successfully implemented then batch conversion of BIDS datasets in the EEG and MEG cases would be realized. It is hoped that this package becomes the backend of an hypothetical web application that assists this conversion of MEG-EEG datasets.</p>\n",

One of these barriers has been the accessibility of shared data; it takes extensive time and effort to understand different data formats and determine which datasets are best suited for the scientific questions being asked. This project is an important step in addressing this challenge. The goal of this project is to convert publicly available datasets to the standardized NeuroData Without Borders (NWB) format so that they can be better interpreted and reused by other researchers. The data will then be made available for interactive analysis and visualization through the NWB explorer on the Open Source Brain repository. By using a standardized data format, researchers can more quickly work with new data and develop analysis methods to apply to a wide variety of datasets. The ability to easily explore and visualize data will also allow researchers to quickly assess the contents of the data and if they can reuse it. Thus, the results of this project will contribute to an important resource for scientists.</p>\n",

In this journey, diffusion MRI (dMRI) and tractography algorithms offer the essential possibility of reconstructing the white matter bundles that interconnect brain regions. Building on this, it is of high interest to obtain tractography bundle atlases that describe the average connectome in different populations. Constructing these atlases, however, requires specific technical expertise and cannot be done in a simple way by using currently available neuroimaging software.</p>\n<p>This project aims to fill this gap by integrating a tractography bundle atlas creation workflow into DIPY, a reference library for dMRI processing in python. The developed solution offers scientists a quick and easy way of obtaining population-specific tractography atlases in an automated fashion. The algorithm takes segmented bundles as input and relies on streamline based registration to align the bundles and construct an atlas. The whole atlas creation process is controlled by the user via a command line interface. Obtained atlases can be exported and used for visualization or further analyses.</p>\n",

However, the original tutorial has been developed using the now obsolete Genesis simulator. Unfortunately, running the Genesis simulator nowadays requires complicated software set up that prevents many non-technical students from accessing the tutorial. We had previously started porting the tutorial to a more modern format that can be executed through a web browser (see  8-cell Leech Heartbeat Network Model Tutorial), increasing the accessibility of this classic tutorial for teaching and research purposes. At this summer’s GSoC, we would like to finish this port and make the tutorial available.

Under the existing implementation of the active segmentation platform, it only supports users with a limited way to load the ground truth for learning ( at the moment only as of the region on interest format (ROI)). Thus, this reduced the usability of the tool and it urges the users to convert the ground truth to the specific format which is designed to be used within the application. Therefore the main contributions under this project will be to incorporate several ground-truth formats as image-based in which each pixel uniquely belongs to a particular class, partial ground truth format in which instead of the whole image and several partial boxes in an image or stack are labeled.</p>\n",

Firstly, it does not only result in a single set of optimal parameters, rather simulation-based inference acts as if the actual statistical inference is performed and provides an estimate of the full posterior distribution over parameters. Secondly, it exploits prior system knowledge sparsely, using only the most important features to identify mechanistic models which are consistent with the measured data. The aim of the project is to support the simulation-based inference in the brian2modelfitting toolbox by linking it to the <code>sbi</code>, <code>PyTorch</code> powered library for simulation-based inference, development of which is coordinated at the Macke lab.</p>\n",

This set of mobile creativity tools for smartphones is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab. The motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.</p>\n<p>Our awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in just a few steps using visual \"Bricks\". Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special \"Bricks\" for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro, etc.) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc. We also work on \"Pocket Code\" for iOS and on a large number of extensions. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up-to-date to meet the current needs of our users.</p>\n<p>Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org), our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as app development, web technologies, graphics, usability, internationalization, or design.</p>\n",

At each level, king Batro fights with one of the evil monsters and crosses the hurdles and In the last level, the king fights with Giant Monster Martian and frees his Kingdom from the evil Monsters.\nThe player follows Batro in his journey. The game story is easily depicted through cinematic cutscenes for better insight. The game is very easy to play and get into, with on-screen controls, and a fairly simple UI. The game is playable on both phones and on a smart TV without looking at the phone's screen while using the phone as a gamepad.

If there's time, a similar search &amp; complete feature can also be added for reporter functions and sensors, and even variable or look names in the formula editor.</p>\n",

JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is an extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification and debugging tools, ranging from software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2021 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, KTH Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, York University - Canada, Brigham Young University, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Minnesota, Charles University - Czech Republic, and National University of Singapore.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be highly extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, we host a number of such extension projects on our own, public JPF server, together with a Wiki that provides a central location for learning about, obtaining, and contributing to JPF.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of correctness properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

Currently, SPF integrates a limited set of dated string constraint solvers. Since string constraint solvers constantly evolve, there is a continuing need to integrate them with SPF. Adding a new string constraint solver into SPF involves augmentation to the existing SPF code. An in-depth understanding of the SPF solver interface is necessary to accomplish this integration. These obstacles lead to a lack of support for state-of-the-art string constraint solvers in SPF. This proposal outlines changes to SPF that would allow integration of Satisfiability Modulo Theories Library (SMT-LIB) compliant solvers with minimal effort and no modifications to existing code. Further, string constraint solvers that are not fully SMT-LIB compliant and require specific translations could be integrated with the addition of a single translation class and no modifications to existing code.</p>\n",

The target benchmark to beat would be “1 auth and rep (using authrep.xml endpoint)” per request. The filter will be written in Rust and then later “translated” into WASM code packaged as WASM Module which is loaded on WASM VMs spun up by a runtime (V8, WAVM, or Wasmtime) embedded inside the Envoy. Many advantages come with using the WASM module instead of the native C++ extension like dynamically loading the filter extension, abstraction from the underlying CPU and programming language used, and being safe from crashing the proxy when a developer makes a mistake. Even though the module is sandboxed, it has the capability for I/O as described in the ABI Specification which empowers us with access to shared data storage (key-value based) and a message queue used in this project.</p>\n",

It comprises a collection of exercises, including recent service robot applications in real life, with different robots such as autonomous cars, drones, or vacuum cleaners. Industrial Robotics is an open-source collection of resources for JdeRobot and exercises for autonomous robotics manipulation. Last year, they incorporated three exercises based on robot manipulation and navigation. Now, the plan is to extend these exercises to Web Templates. For each exercise, a template performs all the auxiliary tasks such as the graphical interface, connection to the sensors and actuators, timing of the code, etc. This also hosts the student’s code. Using this template, the student focuses on robot intelligence (for instance, perception and control algorithms) without wasting time on auxiliary details with little educational value.</p>\n",

With its main concern over the racing track, the Formula 1 (F1) setting solves the line following objective well. However, the presence of 2 separate pipelines for RL and DL is confusing to the users. The DL base works on the JDERobot app, while the RL base takes the privilege of gym-gazebo. These two bases are unable to communicate with each other. Also, the current framework does not leverage the full capabilities of testing scenarios and robots. Apart from line-following, F1 racing for autonomous maneuvers and drone racing has gained much popularity. Although these settings are highly derivative, it requires few significant changes in the control architecture and modularity wrt multiple robot settings. This project’s primary goal is to move towards more extensive support and documentation of Behavior Studio to suit the same RL environment or DL brain to multiple robots with continuous control integration. The advantages of such changes will make the framework more user-friendly and adaptive to various tasks and robot settings.</p>\n",

Keyboard navigation.\nWeb accessibility means designing and developing your website so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with, and contribute to the Web. Occasionally, the dispute over the definition of accessibility is revived.\nIn fact, there are no contradictions between the two approaches. Design that recognizes the needs of all people also serves people with disabilities. Designing, for people with disabilities, brings benefits to all people - also people without disabilities. However, the term \"accessibility\" was defined to draw the attention of designers, not just web designers, to the specific needs of people with disabilities.\nW3C set up a Web Accessibility Initiative whose mission is to ensure that the web is accessible to people with disabilities including auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.</p>\n",

XFSTESTS is considered as the quintessential filesystem regression testing suite and KIO-FUSE would benefit greatly from it. A more rigorous testing regime would translate to an even more robust and reliable filesystem. Testing KIO-FUSE would mean we're testing KIO slaves as well.

It supports procedural programming, object-oriented programming, functional programming, data-driven programming, and data description.</p>\n<p>Lua has been used in many industrial applications (e.g., Adobe's Photoshop Lightroom), with an emphasis on embedded systems (e.g., the Ginga middleware for digital TV in Brazil) and games (e.g., World of Warcraft and Angry Birds). Several versions of Lua have been released and used in real applications since its creation in 1993.</p>\n<p>What is Céu?</p>\n<p>Céu provides \"Structured Synchronous Reactive Programming\", a safe and deterministic concurrency model with side effects. Reactive applications interact continuously with the environment and are mostly guided through input events from it. Céu can be described as a reactive, imperative, concurrent, synchronous, and deterministic language, which easily integrates with C and Lua.</p>\n",

Control of the processing is based on advanced algorithms that must run on a programmable processor. This has traditionally been implemented in a dedicated MCU in the camera, but in embedded devices, algorithms have been moved to the main CPU to save cost. Blurring the boundary between camera devices and Linux often left the user with no other option than a vendor-specific closed-source solution.</p>\n<p>To address this problem the Linux media community is collaborating with the industry to develop a camera stack that is open-source-friendly while still protecting vendor core IP. libcamera was born out of that collaboration and offers modern camera support to Linux-based systems, including traditional Linux distributions, ChromeOS and Android.</p>\n",

As of the time of writing, 400 stations are online in the SatNOGS Network, and tested globally by University satellite teams, organizations, companies, and individual contributors. Data from the Network are stored in the SatNOGS Database and are visualized in the SatNOGS Dashboard.\nFurthermore, the Polaris project can be used to provide insights on satellite telemetry collected by SatNOGS using machine learning technics.</p>\n<p>Libre Space, recently delivered two open-hardware and software PocketQube-class satellites Qubik 1 and Qubik 2, and an open-source hardware and software PocketQube orbital deployment system PicoBus scheduled for launch in 2021Q1 on the inaugural launch of the Firefly Alpha rocket. The Qubik satellites will perform orbital determination and identification experiments and will showcase open-source software and hardware technologies. Additionally, Libre Space, develops an open-hardware and software satellite communication subsystem for CubeSats designed to work seamlessly with the SatNOGS Network.</p>\n<p>Libre Space Foundation is also implementing two European Space Agency activities.

This eventually increases the probability of a variety of space events where some might be catastrophic while others serve as a source of beneficial information of scientific interest.

The potentially harmful ones like orbital collisions can be prevented, and others would allow us to extract meaningful insights about the satellite dynamics. This would ultimately assist in devising optimal orbital design and maintenance strategies.</p>\n<p>The proposed project aims to add event detectors by implementing raw orbital algorithms allowing for increased efficiency and enhanced functionality and configuring them in high-level API. This would ensure swift processing of computationally intensive algorithms while simultaneously allowing to render an easy-to-use API to the user. Consequently, it would allow us to promptly recognize various intricate orbital mechanisms and formulate effective policies based on the outcomes.</p>\n",

Virtually every single person on the planet is fascinated by space – at LibreCube we aim to make it accessible to everyone.</p>\n<h3>What are the concepts of LibreCube?</h3>\n<p>It is great to see that a growing number of communities are forming to liberate access to space. However, the unique proposition of LibreCube are its three core pillars:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Open Source: Everything we do is made available to the public as free and open source from the start. And we only use free and open source tools for our work – this way, really everyone can get involved! </li>\n<li>Free and Open Standards: We rely on proven and tested standards for our system designs, with preference for standards from the space domain. </li>\n<li>Reference Architecture: In order to make all our hardware and software parts to work together and form a system of systems, we use or define standardized interfaces to make it possible to combine and reuse elements for various applications.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>How to find out more?</h3>\n<p>Visit our website at <a href=\"https://librecube.org\" target=\"_blank\">https://librecube.org</a> to learn more about what we are currently working on and what is planned.</p>\n<h3>How to get involved?</h3>\n<p>Go to our online discussion channel to join the community and let us hear from you!</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

This project would aim to do the DOCX import part of it.</p>\n<p>The problem with the current import is that table styles found in DOCX documents are converted into direct formatting at the level of Writer core. This temporarly solution works fine until someone wants to edit the table, which can cause loss of formatting now. Furthermore, doing this conversion upon opening a DOCX document is very slow.</p>\n<p>The aim of my project would be implementing the DOCX import of table styles and removing the current style-based formatting conversion to direct formatting.

There are pre-existing tests that ensure if the former’s the case or not, however, there are still some test cases to be added which would enhance the test’s feasibility thereby helping in examining our graphics more thoroughly. Also, a UI component should be implemented for the users to check the results for themselves so that they could easily provide feedback regarding any graphics issue if present. This task’s main objectives are adding more test cases to the pre-existing tests, running those tests in the client's current backend, and implementing a usable UI for the users to test the graphic’s feasibility themselves.</p>\n",

ML4SCI brings together researchers from universities and scientific laboratories with motivated students to join existing scientific collaborations and contribute to cutting edge science projects across a wide variety of disciplines. Students work on existing problems to develop new machine learning-based approaches and produce open source code that directly contributes to solving these scientific challenges.\nPrior to 2021, some of the ML4SCI projects were part of CERN-HSF umbrella. Since then, ML4SCI has grown to encompass many projects outside of particle physics, and in 2021, ML4SCI operates as a new umbrella organization. We welcome participating machine learning projects from any area of science to take part under the ML4SCI umbrella. \nML4SCI currently includes projects from a variety of fields. For example, some of them explore the uses of machine learning for particle reconstruction and classification in high-energy physics, deep learning-based searches for dark matter in astrophysics, applications of machine learning techniques to data returned from planetary science missions, applications of quantum machine learning to science, and others.\nMachine learning ideas and approaches can be broadly applicable and transferable across the scientific domains. The goals of ML4SCI projects are to grow the open-source community in machine learning for science by addressing important scientific challenges and transferring the knowledge and tools of machine learning across the disciplines. We look forward to your applications!</p>\n",

The CMS experiment detects the resulting particles from the collusion and measures their kinematics using various sub detectors working in concert. High momentum muons are significant objects for many physics analyses at CMS. Therefore, an accurate momentum assignment scheme differentiating low momentum muons (background) from high momentum muons (signal) is crucial to the Endcap Muon Track Finder (EMTF) trigger. The first algorithm implemented in the trigger system was a discretized boosted decision tree. In this study, we will study the use of deep learning algorithms at the trigger level that requires microsecond level latency and therefore highly optimized inference. We will develop and benchmark the graph neural networks (GNN) for momentum regression in the trigger system.

Simulating the particle showers and interactions in the LHC detectors is both time consuming and computationally expensive. Present fast simulation approaches based on non-parametric techniques can improve the speed of the full simulation chain but suffer from lower levels of fidelity. For this reason, alternative methods based on machine learning can provide faster solutions, while maintaining a high level of fidelity. The main goal of a fast simulator is to map the events from the generation level directly to the reconstruction level.

One of the challenges of studying dark matter is actually finding it, as it is only noticeable due to gravitational interactions. Fortunately, recent results have shown that strong gravitational lensing can be used as a probe for studying dark matter’s substructure. Unsupervised learning algorithms are particularly interesting in this field because they allow for the identification of dark matter substructure without a prior theoretical model assumption. While the performance of these algorithms is very promising, there is still a large gap when compared to supervised learning algorithms. One promising possibility is to use domain adaptation techniques to fine tune the models trained on simulation data with real data. Thus, this project will focus on using domain adaptation to account for the differences in the modelling and available real observation data, while also improving the interface with PyAutoLens, the software used for creating the strong lens simulations.</p>\n",

In the wild, however, data is not represented in MapChef’s desired format. It must be prepared. And since manual data acquisition and preprocessing is time-consuming, creating a pipeline for automatization of this work is highly desired. Recently, a series of data pipelines has been implemented.</p>\n<p>At the moment MapAction’s data pipeline framework can deal with two types of data: country boundaries from HDX and roads from OSM.

MDAnalysis accomplishes this goal by providing a toolkit of programming building blocks that provide an abstract Python interface to the simulation data — agnostic of the specific simulation package that produced it — that lends itself to interactive data exploration and rapid prototyping but is also a robust foundational library that can form the basis for <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/pages/used-by/\" target=\"_blank\">new computational tools</a>.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis allows one to read particle-based trajectories such as the ones produced by MD simulations or individual coordinate frames (such as biomolecules in the <a href=\"http://www.rcsb.org/\" target=\"_blank\">protein databank</a> (PDB) format) and access the atomic coordinates through NumPy arrays. Together with a powerful selection language and many implemented analysis algorithms, MDAnalysis provides a flexible and fast framework for complex analysis tasks.</p>\n<p>MDAnalysis strives to be highly interoperable and hence a growing number of projects use MDAnalysis as their foundational library or integrate it. Welcoming documentation such as the new <a href=\"https://www.mdanalysis.org/UserGuide/\" target=\"_blank\">User Guide</a> make it easy to get started.

By integrating a membrane curvature analysis module in MDAnalysis, users will benefit from a tool that enables rapid extraction of relevant properties of lipid bilayers in biomolecular systems. Our approach extracts key elements of the membrane using phospholipid head groups to define a surface, followed by a transformation into NumPy arrays. In this way, the functionality offered by NumPy and SciPy can be used to derive values of mean and gaussian curvature of biological membranes. Since MDAnalysis already works very well to explore data interactively, visualization of the membrane curvature analysis outputs in 2D-maps can be easily performed.</p>\n",

WebAssembly has become prominent in recent years as it can port C++ applications onto web browsers, making code more portable and utilizing the efficiencies of C++. In my GSoC internship, I will combine MediaPipe and WebAssembly by building an open-source realtime web video effects app. I will create a complete workflow of wrapping models in MediaPipe to be used in a webapp for running different ML-based video effects live in the browser using WebAssembly. The workflow will include wrapping the model binaries in calculators, create calculator graphs to use the model binaries, set up Bazel for WebAssembly compilation, write Emscripten bindings to access the models, and create a Typescript webapp to demonstrate how to access the WebAssembly binaries in realtime. I have extensive experience in C++ development, along with web development using Javascript. I have also been using MediaPipe for almost a year and am accustomed to the codebase. Hence, I am confident that I will be successful in my internship.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>When working with different technologies and developers of different programming languages, the productivity of the entire team worsens due to the lack of interoperability and communication between them. If the developers need two technologies which are written in different programming languages, for example, a C/C++ library called from NodeJS, the team usually needs to port to one of the two languages or write a wrapper around them. Maintaining a port of a library or the plumbing code is usually error prone, time consuming and does not add any value to the final product.</p>\n<h3>Why <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core\" target=\"_blank\">MetaCall</a>?</h3>\n<p>The main objective of MetaCall is to provide a transparent interoperability in both ways, no matter what language you are using, so you feel like you are using a library written in the same language but in fact, it may be written in C, NodeJS or whatever.</p>\n<p>We want to allow polyglot applications to be written in a transparent way, and allow multiple developers to work in the same project using <a href=\"https://github.com/metacall/core/blob/develop/docs/README.md#2-language-support\" target=\"_blank\">different languages</a>.</p>\n<h3>How?</h3>\n<p>MetaCall currently provides a mechanism to introspect the types and function signatures which allows us to provide this type info to the caller language. You can have type safety and at the same time avoid boilerplate in both directions.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>MetaCall addresses the main shortcomings of embedding independent languages separately. Having a common implementation with a plugin architecture allows you to implement newer languages without rewriting more code. With a single solution you get C#, Ruby, Python, ... or any language you prefer. We can improve the core continuously and add new languages. Imagine you don't want to use CPython anymore and you want to try PyPy instead because you need performance. Write a new backend and you will only need to change the language tag <strong>\"py\"</strong> by <strong>\"pypy\"</strong> and you are done.</p>\n",

This project improves the following aspects of the animation portion of MIT App Inventor.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enabling users to choose a custom origin for image sprites using a drag-able marker. The origin of a sprite is the root of the sprite's coordinate system. All of the interactions of the sprite that may include collisions, positioning etc. is with respect to the origin. This project implements the desired functionality of custom origin in the appinventor system and adds an interactive way, via a drag-able marker, for selecting this origin easily.  </li>\n<li>Improving the algorithm used to detect collisions among sprites. Right now appinventor uses a naive algorithm to detect collisions between sprites. This collision detection does not work correctly for rotated image sprites and they are treated as if they were unrotated. This projects implements the SAT collision detection algorithm that replaces the naive implementation. This helps detect collisions in rotated image sprites and is more extensible.</li>\n</ol>\n",

Additionally, the trajectories should also be kept so that someone could visualize the trajectory. The seed used in sampling based planners should also be kept. This could be used directly to compare two collision detection algorithms and also for benchmarking CHOMP as a post-processor. We could also do benchmarks on different mesh qualities.

It supports unlimited staves, linked parts and part extraction, tablature, MIDI input and output, percussion notation, cross-staff beaming, automatic transposition, lyrics (multiple verses), fretboard diagrams, and in general everything commonly used in sheet music.</p>\n<p>Style options to change the appearance and layout are available and style sheets can be saved and applied to other scores. In January 2020, MuseScore introduced a unique engraving and notation style built by its full time designer, Martin Keary and engraver Simon Smith.</p>\n<p>MuseScore can play back scores through a sequencer and SoundFont sample library. Playback is currently being greatly expanded to include VST support. MIDI output to external devices and software synthesisers is also possible.</p>\n<p>The team organise themselves according to a general roadmap published by the product owner every six months, which sets out provisional goals for the internal team. This allows the extended developer community to comment on the roadmap and potentially offer to take ownership over aspects of it. This also allows other contributors to have visibility on aspects of the codebase that may change over the next 6-12 months. In combination with our community organiser, tasks are drawn up and published to provide a well organised collaboration focused on a specific upcoming release.</p>\n<p>All members provide bug tracking support and feedback.</p>\n",

It can often significantly speed up Python code. We originally built mypyc to compile mypy, making mypy 4x faster. We are now looking at making mypyc useful for end users as a practical tool to make Python programs and libraries more efficient.</p>\n<p>It's easy to ensure that programs compiled with mypyc continue to also be valid (non-compiled) Python programs.

The objective of the project SBML4Humans is to address this issue by providing  an interactive and reactive report for SBML models which will allow humans (experts as well as beginners) to easily comprehend the content of a model.

CD models involve the analysis of flows from an origin to a destination similarly to traditional SI models, however, CD includes the ‘Competing Destination’ term also known as ‘Accessibility’ term, which accounts for the spatial-structure effect of the flows from behavioural perspective.\nAlthough the SI models are established within Python and R modules already (SpInt, simR),  specification for deriving Accessibility term for CD estimation is missing. \nThis project aims to fill this gap by developing a Competing Destination class that will include the computation of the accessibility term and will be binded to the existing SpInt module. The main challenge here is the scaling of the accessibility computation for large datasets. This is an important aspect of the project as flow datasets often have hundred thousands and even millions records.\nThis project will extend the use of the SpInt module and PySAL library for high level analysis of spatial flows.</p>\n",

PyMC3 has about seven time-series distributions, an important class of models in Probabilistic Programming. This project works on extending this class in a few ways: Firstly, the addition of a new model - namely Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average(ARIMA). Expansion of the existing distributions(and their respective documentation), including Time-Series analysis functions. Thirdly, state-space implementation of possibly a time-varying linear and Gaussian time series model, based on Aesara. Additionally, I believe that Programming can be an efficient way of understanding applied mathematics, motivating me to focus on more pedagogical or explanatory notebooks about Probabilistic Programming (Time-Series in this case). Explanatory Notebooks for ARIMA and state-space model usage, exploring their Econometric applications will be a small step towards fostering an interdisciplinary bond between academia and the open-source community, mutually benefiting both.</p>\n",

It can now handle multiple representations of its data efficiently, for instance dense or sparse matrices. Here we propose to extend the implementation of this class allowing it to handle TensorFlow’s data type which will allow to store and manipulate the data of Qobj using a Graphical Processing Unit (GPU).

The project is broken into multiple methods, each of which has a set timetable during the project. We start by solving the Held-Karp relaxation using the Ascent method from the original paper by Held and Karp. Assuming the result is fractional, we continue into the Asadpour algorithm (integral solutions are optimal by definition and immediately returned). We approximate the distribution of spanning trees on the undirected support of the Held Karp solution using a maximum entropy rounding method to construct a distribution of trees. Roughly speaking, the probability of sampling any given tree is proportional to the product of all its edge lambda values. We sample 2 log <em>n</em> trees from the distribution using an iterative approach developed by V. G. Kulkarni and choose the tree with the smallest cost after returning direction to the arcs. Finally, the minimum tree is augmented using a minimum network flow algorithm and shortcut down to an <em>O(log n / log log n)</em> approximation of the minimum Hamiltonian cycle.</p>\n",

According to the retriever docs, currently the retriever library uses the PostGIS extension for the same. Therefore, the install process to be used for the dashboard will make use of the postgres engine. The spatial datasets are already tested for only download and changes are detected using the md5 hash. This proposal will further that, into proper install of these datasets into Postgres and find out diffs in the databases using PostGIS joins. The results obtained will then be converted into HTML diffs just like we do for non-spatial databases.</p>\n",

If we can \"Gaussianize\" data from such processes in a meaningful way, then we can make better inferences.  We can solve this problem generally by applying a Lambert W transform (Goerg, 2014), which assumes the observed data is distributed as Lambert W x F_X, where F_X is the distribution of the latent input (Goerg , 2011). To apply this transform, we need to estimate parameters of the Lambert W x F_X distribution and also support the inverse transform, so that we can make inferences about the latent input. With this project, we want to support Lambert W x F_X distribution in Stan in an inferential setting, which means: users can build Gaussian models over non-normal data in a transparent way.</p>\n",

The common thing between all these areas is that they are working on structured data - data that can be represented in a table, such as images with a well defined number of rows and columns. An example of unstructured data are graphs - a collections of nodes connected with edges. Although graphs can also be represented through adjacency matrix, this representation implies ordinality of the nodes. Furthermore, once trained on a graph represented this way, a neural network could be used only on the graphs of the same sizes. This was fixed with the introduction of graph neural networks.</p>\n<p>In this project, I will construct models based on graph neural networks and apply them to graphs found in the Reactome database.

Alongside teacher trainings and gender-sensitive school materials, we focus primarily on developing and expanding our visual open-source programming platform “Open Roberta Lab”.</p>\n<p>As one of the leading institutes for applied AI research in Europe, Fraunhofer IAIS aims to use Open Roberta a way to get more people excited about creating new technologies. We provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for literally everybody: in 2020 alone, more than 3 million people from 120 countries programmed their robots and microcontrollers using the Blockly-based programming language \"NEPO\".</p>\n<p>The Open Roberta Lab is a web application running in every browser. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Especially in times of Corona, this simulation has proven to be of great value. A growing number of robots and microcontrollers are now available as simulations in the Lab.</p>\n<p>Open Roberta is becoming increasingly popular with a worldwide community of teachers. In addition to tutorials that can be created independently via an editor, teachers also have the ability to coordinate their classes' assignments and programs in groups.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the shape of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 14 different robot plugins.  Visit them on <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org\" target=\"_blank\">lab.open-roberta.org</a>!</p>\n<p>Interested?

It uses a line-by-line approach, where each absorption or emission line of a molecule is computed by accounting for the influence of environmental parameters. Even though the current implementation can compute high-temperature spectra of millions of lines in just a few seconds it is quite memory hungry. In order to be able to run computations on high-temperature infrared spectra from databases of tens of millions of lines, it is essential to optimize memory consumption in a way that it is possible for us to run reasonably large data on a regular machine (one that has 8 - 16 GB of RAM). RADIS uses Pandas dataframe for handling all the databases currently. Pandas rule of thumb: have 5 to 10 times as much RAM as the size of the dataset. Which makes it impossible to read say a database of size 5GB on a machine with a RAM of 16GB. The goal of this project would be to reduce the memory usage of the current calculations, which would make it possible to compute spectral databases of up to billions of lines.</p>\n",

Although OpenCV.js dnn module is using WebAssembly with multi-threading and SIMD128 optimization, there still exists a huge gap between OpenCV.js and OpenCV native. This is because OpenCV native can leverage more advanced hardware features and even ML-specific accelerators via native instructions and ML APIs. Web Neural Network API (WebNN) is an emerging web standard that allows web apps to access the AI hardware accelerations. It can get near-native performance on a variety of Intel-based platforms through the open source module oneDNN.

      "description_html": "<p>Our world continues to be ravaged by a pandemic of epic proportions, as over 40 million people are infected with or dying from HIV/AIDS -- most (up to 95%) are in developing countries. Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases, and if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as an open-source medical record system framework for developing countries. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self-reliance within resource-constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>Nominatim is a software used to process geocoding requests on OpenStreetMap data. The software uses its own database schema which differs from the one used by the main OSM database. As a result, Nominatim processes OSM data in a way that allows to discover a lot of inconsistencies. The idea of the project is to build a Quality Assurance tool which will analyze the Nominatim database and extract the data errors to multiple formatted JSON files. The errors will be extracted based on a set of rules defined inside the tool. At first, the exported JSON files would be used to present all the errors data to OSM mappers through a visual map on a website. Thus, this tool will help OSM mappers to correct wrong data by taking advantage of the Nominatim internal data structure. The tool should be designed in a way that allows to add new rules easily. In the future, it should also be possible to extract the reports in some other formats in a flexible way. The process would be run once per day against the Nominatim database, stopping regular updates during its execution, so it is crucial that it is optimized to run fast.</p>\n",

That is, to add more features, including customization of orientation, animation, font, opacity. Support right-click to switch the input source or open the tray menu, scroll to switch among pages or candidates, fix candidate box and IME switch list order,  ASCII mode auto-switch, reposition, show or hide candidate box page buttons, set system tray settings, input source indicator with settings. Theme and background picture follow GNOME Night Light Mode, and so on. These customizations will make users find IBus in GNOME familiar if they have just switched from another platform. Eventually, an extension providing full customization of appearance, behavior, system tray, input source indicator for IBus will be available.</p>\n<h4><a href=\"https://github.com/IBus-Customize\" target=\"_blank\">Archived Codebase</a></h4>\n",

The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"https://www.cittametropolitanaroma.it/homepage/elenco-siti-tematici/wifimetropolitano/\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.</p>\n<p>From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue these goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CASPUR</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The software tools, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org\" target=\"_blank\">network management system</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, hoping this will allow a broader audience to benefit from our work.</p>\n",

We use underwater microphones (hydrophones) deployed in key habitats to listen for the calls, whistles, and clicks that SRKWs make almost continuously -- intense signals that can be heard 10 km away, often before the orcas are visible.</p>\n<p>Since a Kickstarter in mid-2017, <a href=\"http://www.orcasound.net/hacker-hall-of-fame/\" target=\"_blank\">key members of our community</a> have built a <a href=\"http://live.orcasound.net\" target=\"_blank\">web app that is connected to 3 hydrophones monitoring the SRKW habitat 24/7</a>. Version 2 of the app, live since May, 2020, lets citizen scientists indicate when they detect orca sounds in the live audio data streams, or other sounds that might harm the orcas, like sonar or noise from ships. The <a href=\"https://github.com/orcasound/orcasite\" target=\"_blank\">web-app code repository</a> has multiple feature branches. Users of version 2 can also receive a notification when orcas are detected, a feature which makes Orcasound a new conservation tool. We expect version 3, designed for both mobile and desktop for the first time, to begin beta-testing in mid-2021. While users enjoy the live “concert” they are offered a timely call to action -- often aimed at reducing the underwater noise pollution near Seattle which impedes the orcas’ ability to communicate &amp; echolocate scarce salmon.</p>\n<p>Orcasound also maintains repositories with other open source tools that support the web app, as well as bioacoustic analysis in general, and killer whale recovery. You can examine and contribute to all our code at <a href=\"http://github.com/orcasound\" target=\"_blank\">Github.com/Orcasound</a>.</p>\n",

The application currently solves a very important problem which falls under resource/project management and as it stands, management can get overwhelming at times. The user application that aims to solve this problem should be more responsive and smooth, in terms of usability, intuitiveness and the value it brings to the end user. In this proposal, I continue to explain how various screens can be made more intuitive as well as faster and more responsive through the use of modern JS libraries and frameworks which have been adopted heavily by the industry such as the React Framework. As explained further, the framework aids in preventing from reinventing the wheel and focusing on features and challenges more worthy of the development time.</p>\n",

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of 1) state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, 2) a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and 3) a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

We adhere to the GNOME Human Interface Guidelines and regularly discuss with artists all around the planet to tackle the hard problems the right way, to make complex tasks easy to accomplish.</p>\n<p>It is a vibrant community-driven project, backed by long standing contributors with a strong interest and experience in multimedia.</p>\n<h4>Ecosystem</h4>\n<p>Pitivi is based on the GStreamer Editing Services library in which we take part. With the GStreamer Editing Services library, we are laying solid foundations for the future based upon over a decade of experience. Built atop the giant shoulders of the industry-standard GStreamer multimedia framework, GES reduces fragmentation and risk while allowing diversity for application writers and adaptability for all kinds of purposes.</p>\n<p>The pipeline-based GStreamer multimedia framework is in use on most of the Linux systems. GStreamer, being cross-platform, is used widely also on Win, Mac and on embedded devices. Thus, lots of people benefit when we fix a bug upstream, in GStreamer, or push for new features to cover the demanding video-editing use-case.</p>\n<p>In addition to GStreamer's own codecs and video/audio effects, we can use other framework's codecs and effects, such as FFMPEG and Frei0r, through various GStreamer plugins available in the good/bad/ugly collections. You have any multimedia building-block you might want in Pitivi.</p>\n<h4>Tooling</h4>\n<p>The many dependent libraries make video editing apps very complex. We use Flatpak to build a dev env in which we know exactly what version of the dependencies exist. Thus you can create a working and stable dev env with minimal effort.</p>\n",

Plan 9 demonstrates a new and often cleaner way to solve most systems problems. The system as a whole is likely to feel tantalizingly familiar to Unix users but at the same time quite foreign.</p>\n<p>In Plan 9, each process has its own name space. A process may rearrange, add to, and remove from its own name space without affecting the name spaces of unrelated processes. This includes the ability to mount a connection to a file server speaking 9P, a simple file protocol. The connection may be a network connection, a pipe, or any other file descriptor open for reading and writing with a 9P server on the other end. Customized name spaces are used heavily throughout the system, to present new resources (e.g., the window system), to import resources from another machine (e.g., the network stack), or to browse backward in time (e.g., the dump file system). For example, device drivers in Plan 9 work by exposing a 9P server, typically mounted in /dev, and can be imported from other systems, transparently.</p>\n<p>Over time, Plan 9 has given rise to a number of offshoot projects. Inferno took many of the systems-level ideas, combined them with Limbo, a new concurrent programming language, and built them into a system which could run on bare hardware or hosted on another operating system. Plan9port takes many of the user-mode libraries and utilities and enables them to run on Unix-like systems. Each of these extends the ways Plan 9's ideas can be applied to different classes of problems.</p>\n<p>In addition to these directly related projects, ideas from Plan 9 have found their way into many other operating systems and environments. The /proc filesystem in several unixes, the rfork() call in various BSD systems, the 9P interface WSL uses to talk to Linux systems, and even UTF-8 all come from Plan 9. The concurrent programming model in Go came directly from that found in Inferno's Limbo.</p>\n",

Furthermore, it features a flexible schema supporting schema changes at runtime.</p>\n<p>Polypheny is a full database management system providing support for a rich set of data types. Due to its support for features like the enforcement of constraints, transactions, prepared statements, and batch queries, it even goes beyond of what many well-known DBMS provide.</p>\n<p>Moreover, Polypheny comes with integrated support for several specialized database management systems. Therefore, it is able to efficiently process heterogeneous workloads. The seamless combination of data replication and data partitioning allows to combine different underlying data storage engines in order to provide excellent query performance independent of the type of workload.</p>\n<p>Polypheny even goes a step further in terms of flexibility: With \"Data Sources\" it is possible to map data on (remote) database systems into the schema of Polypheny. It also features an adapter for directly querying CSV files.</p>\n<p>The JDBC-SQL and the REST query interface allow to easily integrate Polypheny into existing environments using industry standard techniques. The powerful browser-based user interface makes managing Polypheny a pleasant experience.</p>\n<p>In conjunction with the support for multi-media data and workloads, Polypheny offers a flexibility not matched by existing polystore systems.</p>\n",

We sponsor a Fellowship Program that funds exploratory, creative, and technical research; support an Advocacy Program, which focuses on nurturing diverse communities and their specific projects; produce public events that provide platforms for collaboration between our contributors; and take part in panels and talks that spread the word about the need for diversity in these fields.</p>\n<p>At our core is the philosophy and politics of free, libre, open-source software. We see software as a medium, something that connects two things. We view it as a means for thinking and making. We believe it should be free. We believe that learning to program is not about acquiring a certain skill set, but is instead a creative and exploratory process. We believe software, and the tools to learn it, should be accessible to everyone. We believe software literacy and an understanding of media of all kinds is essential knowledge for today.</p>\n",

There are three kinds of pages and each works differently: References, examples, and other web pages. References Pages are built-in English and swapped to other languages using JS on the front-end. Translation content is stored in a JSON object. For every new page, we need to create a key-value pair in the hi.yml file. A single JS template is also needed. Examples pages are built from templates with handlebars, while examples are stored in JS files. To implement i18n, new templates were created specifically for the Hindi language, so that Examples were rendered properly. Other pages are built from templates in which Handlebars point to the content in the actual language when rendered.</p>\n<p>The entire website is deployed and it is live at  <a href=\"https://p5js.org/hi/\" target=\"_blank\">https://p5js.org/hi/</a></p>\n",

AR Kit, Apple's augmented reality API, is another possible item that might be included. I am a computational artist and designer as well as an iOS developer. I have taught Creative Coding to a very diverse student body at the community college level since 2015 and with Swift since 2018 using various frameworks. For this I've \"flipped\" courses and built out asynchronous online courses with videos and tutorials. My experience teaching Swift has given me insight into what makes an API and its examples/tutorials successful. Swift creates unique challenges for new learners.

However, it is the Wiki community that created such a giant knowledge base. WikiLoop is an initiative to make tech people contribute back to the greater Wiki community including open knowledge institutions, academia and researchers who are interested in advancing computer-based technologies. With contributor's technical skillset and vision, typical WikiLoop projects help Wikipedia and its sister projects improve their knowledge sources and help the community by empowering humans and bootstrapping machines.</p>\n<p><strong>Tibetan Initiative: Preserving Precious Tibetan Buddhist Heritage</strong>\nOne of the targets of WikiLoop is to help knowledge institutions to preserve their precious knowledge. Tibetan language and culture is an example that could be benefited from WikiLoop.\nTibetan literature contains rich explorations of psychology, spirituality, and human experience continue to serve as a consistent source of inspiration to Western philosophy and psychology, as well as other modern sciences. There are millions of Tibetan speakers around the world. However, the Tibetan language is much underserviced in the digitized world. For example, it lacks modern NLP technologies such as machine translation, and basic NLP foundations such as tokenization. And existing efforts of knowledge preservation are isolated. So it is a good starting point for the WikiLoop project, where things could be connected to make a great impact.</p>\n<p><strong>Your GSoC Opportunity</strong>\nWe have a list of ideas targeting preserving Tibetan heritage but also could be expanded into a much larger scope by connecting other institutions and communities depending on students' preference.</p>\n",

This in turn requires them to know various file manipulation methods, which are easier to use on linux than on windows. To simplify this process, I propose to create a checker creation helper script, which would take .rpm, .deb, .tar.gz or other files that represent packaged versions of the software to be detected, including the product name and version number that we expect to find in each as a set of inputs.\nThe script would automate the process mentioned in the <a href=\"https://github.com/intel/cve-bin-tool/blob/main/cve_bin_tool/checkers/README.md\" target=\"_blank\">checkers/readme.md</a></p>\n<p><strong>Recommending Safe Package Versions</strong> -\nCurrently, cve-bin-tool outputs the vulnerable package name, version and vendor-product name. An upgrade to this would be to also provide the user with the list of all safe/fixed packages for the corresponding vulnerable packages found while scanning.\nThis could be done by taking a vulnerable package (which was found in the scan) and web-scraping for the latest vulnerable version and then comparing it with all it’s released versions and then giving the safe version as output. An extended goal to this could be to automate the final downloading process.</p>\n",

Therefore, it is important to have a software that can visualize and provide insights into such structures. Unfortunately, the vast majority of network visualization and manipulation software currently available has several limitations.  For example, Gephi (Java) does not scale well when the number of nodes increases and cannot deal with 3d layout algorithms. Because of those limitations in the currently available network visualization software, we propose to develop a client/server network visualization for FURY. Our proposed system is inspired by the following work: “Harnessing WebGL and WebSockets for a Web-Based Collaborative Graph Exploration Tool”.</p>\n",

The subject must also have a computed tomography (CT) image taken during or after the implantation surgery. The pre-surgical MRI has better resolution of the brain anatomy than the CT, whereas the CT shows the positions of the electrode contacts.

Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, ASR, audio parsing, gesture analysis, media analysis, computer vision, and multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function—an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2021, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks.

I want to upgrade it to a parallelized algorithm to process multiple frames in a batch and increase the processing speed exponentially, which will also help in faster testing of hyperparameters.

This requires from us to have better understanding how videos are constructed. Videos are constructed by combining different shots of the camera placed after each other. A combination of different shot transition creates the final video at the end. The final video contain visual effects which could be classified into two main categories: sharp and gradual. The former is a sudden change of the shot over 1 frame, while gradual transitions occur over multiple frames. Gradual transitions are further classified into dissolve and non-dissolve. The former includes cases such as semi-transparent graduals, fade in and fade out. Non-dissolve are dominated by wipes. Wipe graduals have a much wider variety than the dissolve graduals.</p>\n",

The research task is to detect hand gestures in raw news videos which are streams of RGB images.  I propose a Transformer and keypoints-based pose tracking system and a Transformer and keypoints-based gesture detector to fulfill this task. This structure is composed of a keypoints extractor, a person tracker, and a gesture detector. The mission has three main parts, the first part is to track people in temporal space. In the second part, for each person, we use their hand keypoints features in temporal space to construct several keypoints sequences. The third part is to use these sequences to make predictions of the existence of gestures. I believe that for gesture detection tasks, both spatial and temporal information is important. So that is why we use the Transformer which can take into account the local information of hand keypoints in one frame to capture the shape information and it values also the relationship of keypoints in different frames that is the global information refer to the motion.</p>\n",

This project is a predator-prey agent-based modeling attempt to simulate an ecological setup consisting of vervet monkeys as they interact with predators and give alarm calls.

For example, Rizin loads sections information at the start. But it is common knowledge that section information can be manipulated without modifying the program execution. With this issue comes the fact that Rizin uses section information to deduct imported functions, strings and for other various analyses. Therefore, we need to make the section loading optional. The second problem is how Rizin loads PLT data. Currently, the PLT is linked to the GOT using hard coded values, which should be replaced by a dynamic analysis like in Ghidra.</p>\n",

After completing this project, users would be able to get information about the state of the heap in Cutter and do this for cases of remote debugging and a variety of allocators. \nAs part of the project, the following are the key features that will be added and changed:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Widgets in Cutter for the following:</li>\n<li>Bins Info (Fastbins, Unsorted, Small, Large)</li>\n<li>T-cache Info for each thread</li>\n<li>Arenas Info (chunks, top, last remainder)</li>\n<li>Graph visualization for bins and tcache</li>\n<li>Improve the implementation of heap related commands like <code>dmh</code> in Rizin</li>\n<li>Refactor the Rizin code to make heap parsing work for non-native code</li>\n<li>Add heap parsing for other allocators like MacHeap.</li>\n</ul>\n",

Components may require, subscribe, implement or publish interfaces in a seamless way. Building new components is done using two domain-specific languages, IDSL and CDSL. With IDSL you define an interface and with CDSL you specify how the component will communicate with the world. With this information, a code generator creates C++ and/or Python sources, based on CMake, that compile and execute flawlessly. When some of these features have to be changed, the component can be easily regenerated and all the user-specific code is preserved thanks to a simple inheritance mechanism.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>With the advent of Machine Learning, one can learn such heuristics and use them as cost functions in conventional path planners. SNGNN-1D is one such Graph Neural Network based Machine Learning algorithm which evaluates the static scenes generated randomly from the point of view of the robot. In short, it outputs a score between 0-100 which shows how good the robot’s position is with respect to its surroundings. This score, for every state in the room, is used to generate a heat map that is used by A* algorithm to plan a path to the goal position. The problem with this implementation is that it is computationally expensive and is relatively slow, also SNGNN has been trained using static scenes and does not factor in dynamic settings for example, walking humans, which is a very common scenario in a social setting. A more cost effective way to carry out this task would be to train a policy to reach the goal. However, it is difficult to structure a reward function for complex environments. In such cases, Reinforcement Learning is a promising pursuit that can make use of SNGNN-1D as a reward function because it scores the robot’s presence in the room with respect to its surroundings.</p>\n",

However, there's still a long way to go - some strings still lack translation, others need to be removed, etc. Currently, the translation process is entirely manual, making it even harder to manage that much information. To speed up the internationalization process, our goal is to build a tool that makes translators live's easier. We want to create a CLI app that helps in the translation process, answering questions like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which strings weren't translated yet? </li>\n<li>Which strings are not mentioned in the codebase anymore? </li>\n<li>What is the translation progress for a given language?</li>\n</ul>\n<p>We want to make the actual translating easier, providing an interactive interface to add or remove translations.

B_{20}(3z) is a B-term, which stands for an expression which is bounded in absolute value by\n3|z| for |z| ≥ 20. Sometimes, in research, it is important to know from which values of the variable on the asymptotic expression has enough precision to decide wether it is larger than a given bound. This cannot be achieved by O-terms (because the unknown implicit constant might be very large). For example, the average number of comparisons of classical quicksort is 2n log n + O(n). When comparing with recent variants, such as dual pivot quicksort with average number of comparisons 1.8n log n + O(n), it is interesting to know how large the O-terms are in order to know when dual-pivot quicksort will be more efficient than classical quicksort.</p>\n",

It turns out to be practical to denote it as an infinite series, although it does no longer represent a function.  However, the usual operations on power series, such as addition and multiplication, can be given combinatorial meaning, which makes them an indispensable tool in discrete mathematics. Lazy Formal Power Series are an implementation of the Formal Power Series for a computer where coefficients are only computed on-demand, to deal with the problem that we can store only a finite amount of information.\nSageMath has an implementation of the Lazy Formal Power Series in the combinatorial species code. The project aims to disentangle the code from the unrequired submodules and create a robust structure. Another aim of the project is to implement Puiseux Series and bring in the implementation of the Laurent Series code into the same module. There are also bugs in the code that computes the coefficients of series which are defined implicitly by a system of functional equations.  Fixing these is another milestone. A detailed list of issues and tasks can be found in ticket #31651 on the Sage Trac server.</p>\n",

There is also a large pool of capable and motivated contributors. The first mission of the Scala Center is to consult with the user community, define common goals, and organize contributions and its own resources to achieve these goals.\nThe Scala Center is a designated unit at EPFL, independent from the Scala research group (LAMP).</p>\n<h3>The Scala Language</h3>\n<p>Scala is an acronym for “Scalable Language”. This means that Scala grows with you. At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.\nScala is the technology of choice for a vibrant open-source ecosystem, including popular platforms and frameworks such as Spark, Kafka, Akka, Finagle, Cats, and Play, to name just a few.</p>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.\nEven though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n",

In between producers and consumers, intermediaries hold a powerful position that can decide the monetary values of the services. Understanding the value of the intermediary-existence, it is proposed to mitigate this drawback using blockchain-based smart contracts where both producers and consumers hold control of transaction flow. The pricing mechanism will be transparent, yet privacy preserving. This would empower both producers and consumers and be the first step of the ultimate goal -- everything-as-a-service in the future.</p>\n",

Originally focused on 2D Point&amp;Click adventure games, its scope widened in 2016 to RPG thanks to a successful GSoC students, and to 3D games in 2020 after the merge with its sister project, ResidualVM. The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master and Hyperspace Delivery Boy. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run thounsands of games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 30 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 3,300,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n<p>Since its merge with ResidualVM, ScummVM is also a 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Today’s application developers are faced with the harsh reality that the conventional methods of parallel execution are up against the wall.  Hardware development is beginning to slow, and the free lunch is almost over.  In this climate, it is more important now than ever to rethink our traditional approaches to parallel computation.  New solutions must be developed with the scalability of applications being central to their design.</p>\n<p>The STE||AR Group is an international team of researchers who understand that a new approach to parallel computation is needed.  Our work is crafted around the idea that we need to invent new ways to more efficiently use the resources that we have and use the knowledge that we gain to help guide the creation of the machines of tomorrow.  While we develop several software products, the library which is most heavily developed and core to our team is HPX. The HPX runtime system is stirring up the pot by providing a modern implementation of all C++ standard facilities related to parallelism and concurrency, extended for the distributed use case.  HPX is a general purpose C++ runtime system for parallel and distributed applications of any scale. It strives to provide a unified programming model which transparently utilizes the available resources to achieve unprecedented levels of scalability.  For more information about HPX please see <a href=\"https://hpx.stellar-group.org/\" target=\"_blank\">here</a>. As you can see from our <a href=\"https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/wiki/Google-Summer-of-Code-%28GSoC%29-2021\" target=\"_blank\">ideas page</a>, there are more possible projects for yourself to be involved with -- be creative!</p>\n<p>We envision HPX as a library which provides services to applications which makes writing efficient, maintainable, and scalable parallel and distributed codes much simpler than current popular paradigms. Currently, HPX is used to develop scientific and industrial applications and in the future we hope to expand its influence to include common applications that touch our everyday lives.</p>\n",

Basic functionalities of a Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) control system package were added last year by Naman as part of his GSoC project. These included <code>TransferFunction</code>, <code>Feedback</code>, <code>Series</code> and <code>Parallel</code> classes. Although being available in the latest release of SymPy (v1.8), these functionalities require further improvements before becoming fully useful for an engineer or a student. Apart from these modifications in the original implementation, I plan to add some of the missing features to complete the LTI submodule. These include-</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>TransferFunctionMatrix</code> for MIMO systems.

It is capable to produce vector artwork and also can work with bitmap images.</p>\n<p>The main concept of Synfig is \"tweening\" - you can define object positions or shapes of vector objects at certain points of time and program will interpolate in-between frames automatically. You can also use bones to control your animation on higher level.</p>\n<p>With Synfig you can easily create motion graphics and cut-out animations for product explanation videos, tutorial videos, and more.</p>\n<h3>Main features</h3>\n<p><strong>- Vector tweening</strong>\nTransform any vector shape into another! Synfig gives you powerful tools to control every vertex of your vector artwork. Just set the key positions and inbetween frames will be calculated automatically.</p>\n<p><strong>- Layers and Filters</strong>\nSynfig provides 50+ layers to create artwork and animation of any complexity. Choose from various layer types: geometric, gradients, filters, distortions, transformations, fractals and others.</p>\n<p><strong>- Bones</strong>\nA bone system allows to create cutout animation using bitmap images or control your vector artwork. With an additional Skeleton Distortion layer it is possible to apply complex deformations to bitmap artwork.</p>\n<p><strong>- Linking elements</strong>\nYou can link parameters of various layers – directly or through mathematical expressions. This allows you to create advanced character puppets and other dynamic structures.</p>\n<h3>Examples of works created with Synfig</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecVv2IB7f5k\" target=\"_blank\">Morevna Episode 3</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSL-NdoOLQc\" target=\"_blank\">Polar Detective</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N8SF_-gJ0_w\" target=\"_blank\">Synfig Promo Video</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fWAxFc9FPwA\" target=\"_blank\">Demo Reel by VanChatto</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dVamedBYq8\" target=\"_blank\">The Deadline</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cgSI3IcyXhs\" target=\"_blank\">Pluto takes life</a></li>\n</ul>\n",

However, those are primarily meant for filtering and don't store extracted groups by default (despite we can manually add store-matches flags option). To make up for this deficiency, this project is to develop a new parser type, here I call it <strong>regexp-parser()</strong>. The motivation behind <strong>regexp-parser()</strong> is to remove the need to use filters to extract name-value pairs from content, which has traditionally been done by parsers. And these names can be used as user-defined macros for subsequent filtering or other types of message processing.</p>\n",

The DBMS was originally developed as an in-memory NoSQL DBMS, and later it was extended with a disk storage engine option. Now it is positioned as in-memory computing platform. Tarantool's in-memory engine is lock-free. It uses cooperative multitasking to handle thousands of connections simultaneously. There is a fixed number of independent execution threads and they do not share state. The disk-based storage engine also exploits the advantage of single-threaded requests and hence avoid unnecessary synchronization overhead. Tarantool also supports secondary indexes, asynchronous replication, and some SQL operations.</p>\n",

Therefore, users have to edit text files manually in order to change the model composition, which tends to be inefficient and inconvenient for them. In this case, a custom abundance widget is proposed to provide a more convenient way in supernovae exploration.

This consists of my contribution to the architecture and implementation of these models.</li>\n<li>Proposing models to add: I am making sure I keep my innovative side in this program by trying to suggest ideas of models that can be added to TF Hub.  For instance, there are few models that treat underrepresented languages in NLP, like Arabic. My contribution to this can be crucial as I have experience dealing with these types of models and am aware of the difficulties someone can encounter when dealing with this. This can also be generalized in other fields, not only NLP</li>\n</ul>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>ENIGMA comprises three principal components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>An integrated development environment</strong> meant to help users organize their game's assets and logic in a way that is free of boilerplate and easy to reason about.</li>\n<li><strong>A compiler</strong> that builds these game files into executable code, with generated asset management boilerplate (among other game engine basics).</li>\n<li><strong>An engine</strong> that integrates with the user's built game to drive the core logic and tie everything together.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>ENIGMA is meant to be simple to learn and even simpler to work with. ENIGMA makes it refreshingly easy to stand up simple games. Recreating Atari Pong is a job for a handful of minutes. This is true in many modern engines, but unlike most, ENIGMA scales well to positively enormous games, as the engine (and ultimately, all user code) is written in C++.</p>\n<p>Users write code in EDL, a language similar to JavaScript (or, more to the point, Game Maker Language) which compiles intermediately to C++. The emitted C++ is optimized based on the game's asset usage, and the result is a C++ game project which can be built by any C++ compiler (we target Clang and GCC). This offers massive portability and library support.</p>\n<p>The compiler bundles a C++ parser which crawls the engine for definitions. This theoretically allows users to access library routines directly (e.g. OpenGL), though we recommend against this for portability reasons. This framework is another good surface for GSoC projects, though it's more advanced, so we've left it unexplored in our project ideas list.</p>\n<p>To really understand the utility of the project, consider a typical game, which uses \"rooms\" (a type of ENIGMA asset) to lay out instances of \"objects\" (game entity classes) visually. The objects contain code for specific events (such as step, draw, or keyboard) which can call out to scripts or begin timelines or start movement on paths. ENIGMA's compiler translates this to C++ and builds it against the engine after parsing both to learn how to integrate them.</p>\n",

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

Today, rolling out a new model has become ever easier with the popularization of open-source frameworks such as scikit-learn and MLJ. Despite the unprecedented accessibility, designing effective models with appropriate hyperparameters remains obscure for the common user without high-level technical understanding and expert intuition. In an effort to automate the process of tweaking hyperparameters, MLJ has introduced a unified interface for tuning models, providing support for widely used strategies like grid and random search. The available schemes, however, primarily perform exhaustive testings on selected hyperparameter combinations. In this proposal, I present a plan to implement a new strategy, particle swarm optimization (PSO), which utilizes information from past attempts to improve hyperparameter search. The first section offers a summary of the method and existing implementations, while the second sketches the technical details of a PSO algorithm for MLJ and a tentative timeline to deliver the project’s goals.</p>\n",

The SuiteSparse GraphBLAS (SS:GrB) implementation will be the primary target, and support for the several extensions to the specification in SS:GrB is also a goal.

Specifically, we intend to extend the packages Fairness.jl and MLJ.jl to include methods that implement counterfactual fairness, a recent definition of fairness.

Our contribution allows performing general purpose symbolic mathematics, manipulation, optimization, synthesis or analysis of syntactically valid Julia expressions and user defined types, with a clean and concise programming interface, both during compilation or execution of programs. We have been currently experimenting with optimizing mathematical code and equational theorem proving strategies. Some of the proposed tasks for this project include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Experimenting with <a href=\"https://github.com/JuliaSymbolics/Symbolics.jl\" target=\"_blank\">Symbolics.jl</a> integration and optimization for symbolic mathematics.</li>\n<li>Experiments in optimizing lowered Julia IRs (possibly by statically overlaying methods with <a href=\"https://github.com/femtomc/Mixtape.jl\" target=\"_blank\">Mixtape.jl</a>), allowing users to define concise rewrite systems that directly optimize Julia code.</li>\n<li>Experimenting in encoding category theory axioms to efficiently model string diagrammatic equational reasoning, and to produce human readable equational proofs.

          "abstract_html": "<p>To realise the full potential of probabilistic programming languages (PPLs), it is essential to automate the inference of latent variables in the model, conditioned on the observed data. Hence PPLs usually come with built-in algorithms to perform Bayesian inference on such models automatically. However, due to the expressiveness of PPLs, it is very challenging to design general purpose inference algorithms for models specified in Turing-complete PPLs. Applications tend to build their own custom inference machines, which is time consuming and labour intensive. \nThis proposal puts forward a recently introduced framework—the involutive Markov chain Monte Carlo (iMCMC), as a candidate for inference in a PPL, namely Turing. Such a framework would enable the automation of an implementation of a correct inference algorithm from user specifications in Turing. Moreover, Turing readily supports differentiable programming (in their HMC implementation) which is the main technical requirement of iMCMC. Early iMCMC developments in Gen show promising results compared to standard black box styled inferences. Hence, it would be desirable to have an implementation in Turing.</p>\n",

This tool was initially released for Linux developers who send patches on mailing lists, but it can also be applied to other projects. To describe matching and transformation rules in the source code with a patch-like appearance, Coccinelle employs a domain specific language called the Semantic Patch Language (SmPL), and attempts to manipulate the given C code based on the given SmPL rule.  Although SmPL can provide many useful matching and transformation features, there are limits to the C matching patterns that the SmPL grammar can express due to the complexity of the C grammar. This is particularly the case for function headers, that involve complex types, annotations, etc that have been somewhat less tested by the users of Coccinelle. This project will study the current status and limitations of the handleability of function headers by designing and running a script that checks whether each function header in a given project can be parsed correctly and applying it to the latest Linux kernel. Based on the results, any detected problems will be fixed.</p>\n",

Since then, LLVM has grown to be an umbrella project consisting of a number of different subprojects, many of which are being used in production by a wide variety of commercial and open source projects as well as being widely used in academic research.</p>\n<p>The primary sub-projects of LLVM are:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The LLVM Core libraries provide a modern source- and target-independent optimizer, along with code generation support for many popular CPUs. These libraries are built around a well specified code representation known as the LLVM intermediate representation (\"LLVM IR\").</li>\n<li>Clang is an \"LLVM native\" C/C++/Objective-C compiler, which aims to deliver amazingly fast compiles, extremely useful error and warning messages and to provide a platform for building great source level tools.

It is a verification framework for LLVM IR, which checks whether the source and target IR are equivalent or disproves by providing a counterexample. Alive2 can reason about a wide variety of intraprocedural optimization problems, including control flow, memory, vectors, and floating-point.

One way to speed up running of the tests could be to distribute test execution across many computers too. Lit provides a test sharding mechanism, which allows multiple computers to run parts of the same testsuite in tandem, but this currently assumes access to a single common filesystem, which may not be possible in all cases and a knowledge of which machines the suite can currently be run on.</p>\n",

It is difficult to determine whether an optimization is correct because bugs occur in corner cases and it’s hard to test them all for each optimization. But, thanks to Alive2, we can formally check the correctness of optimizations. Many of the bugs found are related to the notion of undef and poison values in LLVM. The semantics of these values has been formalized recently, and existing optimizations are being fixed to match the semantics. For example, branching on undef is now defined as undefined behavior (UB), and several branch-related optimizations are being fixed. However, fixing some of the optimizations requires further work, mainly due to performance concerns. One representative example is loop unswitch: it is incorrect, but still unfixed because fixing it causes big regressions in some benchmarks. Our goal is to fix such miscompilations with minimal-to-no performance regression. This project will investigate what is necessary to recover slowdowns and upstream the patches to LLVM.</p>\n",

Enzyme is made as a plugin of LLVM and synthesizes differentiated functions directly on optimized LLVM IR code, which provides it with advantages in efficiency and universality. From another aspect, Rust is an emerging high-performance and safe language. Many of its users are trying to bring machine learning to it, thus an high-performance and user-friendly AD tool needed. Enzyme is a good option for this demand. However, without a deep integration into Rust, Enzyme's user experience with Rust is not so good, and more importantly, it may suffer from performance reduction due to wasted Rust meta-information. These problems hamper Enzyme from being widely used in Rust. This project will tackle the aforementioned problems through integrating Enzyme into Rust and then provide high-performance differentiation in Rust.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Are you interested in contributing to a widely-used performance evaluation tool for computer networking research? <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org\" target=\"_blank\">ns-3</a> is a <em>discrete-event, packet-level network simulator</em> with an emphasis on networking research and education. Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is a high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.33 in January 2021). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 9500 members as of February 2021, averaging over 8 posts per day. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base has a total of 295 authors and around 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

A significant proportion of our software contributions come from university students studying software engineering. Participants often come from under-served communities or geographic areas and are sponsored through our various programs. This prepares them for the competitive realities of the working world.\nLife started for us in 2016 when a group of expatriate Jamaicans wanted to assist development of new and existing information technologies for the island’s social good.  We knew academic and student leadership wanted greater practical exposure to the latest technology. In response, our pilot Calico program for Jamaican universities was created with the goal of addressing the issues graduates would face when employed. \nAfter five years of success, members of the Jamaican diaspora suggested we expand our service area to be global. They saw similar needs in their own under-served communities where the digital divide is very visible and thought our experience in the developing world would be useful.\nWe have had many open-source projects. For the past three years we have focused on creating a mobile app to help community organizations like ourselves better manage their membership. We saw the need for a social media component to keep in contact with our volunteers. We also faced challenges with the project management of events and keeping track of volunteer abilities, roles and responsibilities. \nWe want to make the app useful for any community-based organization such as clubs, small religious institutions, neighborhood groups, and volunteer associations. We also want to see how the software could be installed as a multi-tenant, multi-site hosted service like WordPress as many of these organizations often don’t have sufficient IT skills. We hope that our GSoC students will help us achieve this goal in 2021.</p>\n",

There are about eight packages supplied with the R distribution and many more are available through the CRAN family of Internet sites covering a very wide range of modern statistics.</p>\n<p>R has its own LaTeX-like documentation format, which is used to supply comprehensive documentation, both on-line in a number of formats and in hardcopy.</p>\n",

Consider the clinical trial design as an example. Optimizing the clinical trial design is essential to decrease the cost of drug development, as the average costs are up to 52.9 million US dollars for a Phase 3 trial [1]. The current approach formulates multi-stage decision-making as a general Linear Programming (LP) problem, which however, is computationally expensive especially in large-scale settings. In this project, we aim to develop new customized algorithms and an R package for multi-stage decision-making problems with three key features: 1) It provides a highly efficient solver to tackle a large and important class of sparse LP problems; 2) It provides a solution for multi-stage decision-making problems with Bayes risk constraints; 3) It provides additional functions such as visualization of the optimal decision maps.</p>\n",

This would involve migrating to Rcpp, parallel implementation of functions and implementing alternate algorithms for the task. In addition, improvements to the existing implementation by correcting for numerical instabilities, Rcpp sugar implementations, solving for error or warning messages in corner cases, updating documentation and developing a class identifiable with the output form an integral part of the project.

We've been working for years on educational awareness, challenging architecture, powerful developer workspaces, fun content, and much more.</p>\n<p>Our contributors are a diverse mix of software developers, designers, game testers, graphic artists, and musicians of all ages. We encourage and appreciate contributions from everybody, and try to be as warm and welcoming as possible to newcomers.</p>\n<h3>Our Games</h3>\n<p>Terasology is a highly extensible open source voxel-based game. Born from a Minecraft-inspired tech demo, it is gradually becoming a stable platform for all sorts of gameplay settings in a voxel world.</p>\n<p>From the ground up, Terasology was built to be a super hackable and modular game. We host a large amount of game content modules under the Terasology organization on GitHub, all community maintained. We welcome new ideas, both crazy and well thought-out for modules and game extensions from anyone and everyone, so feel free to talk to us on IRC, Discord, or Slack.</p>\n<p>Destination Sol is a fun little space arcade shooter we adopted as open source to learn more about LibGDX, releasing on Steam and Google Play, and to have somewhere to apply our frameworks.</p>\n<h3>Architecture.</h3>\n<p>Our engine is meant to be light, secure, and flexible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. Game distributions then include modules that provide basic gameplay.</p>\n<p>Content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates. Creating a new module is as easy as running a single command, same for fetching source for any existing community module.</p>\n<p>The game itself can auto-download modules if needed with full dependency resolution included!</p>\n",

The problem with the current implementation of Light &amp; Shadow is the lack of viable resources/weapons in the inventory of the player that can be used to prevent the advance of the enemy team. This makes the game a race for the flag rather than a battle for the flag which definitely sounds less interesting.\nThis project first focuses on stabilizing the current gameplay mode by fixing certain bugs and making a few improvements to the existing gameplay mechanisms and UI.  It then tackles the problem mentioned above by introducing currencies and improving the inventory a player spawns with to allow for more defensive structures to be built and additional weapons/traps to be used along with various effects to help change the pace of the game. In addition to this, the entire module which is split in two has to be merged, interaction with the external modules improved, unnecessary code removed and documentation added.</p>\n",

EDK II is a modern, feature-rich, cross-platform firmware development environment for the UEFI and UEFI Platform Initialization (PI) specifications.</p>\n<p>In June of 2004, Intel announced that it would release the “Foundation Code” of its Extensible Firmware Interface (EFI), a successor to the 16-bit x86 “legacy” PC BIOS, under an open source license. This Foundation Code, developed by Intel as part of a project code named Tiano, was Intel’s “preferred implementation” of EFI. This evolved into EDK, EDK II, and other open source projects under the TianoCore community.</p>\n<p>The EFI Specifications were contributed to the United EFI Forum as part of the original UEFI Specifications, which has been adopted by over 200 companies and shipped on millions of compute devices.

The software originates at the Databases and Information Systems (DBIS) research group of the University of Basel, Switzerland and has evolved into a thriving community involving people inside and outside of academia who’s common interest is multimedia retrieval.</p>\n<p>The vitrivr-stack and individual components thereof have won various awards over the years. The stack consists of three independent systems written in Java, Kotlin and Typescript:</p>\n<p>Cottontail DB: Is a column store that combines classical boolean retrieval and vector space retrieval used for multimedia search in a unified data and query model. It can be used as a standalone component independent of vitrivr and queries can be formulated through a gRPC API.</p>\n<p>Cineast: Is a feature extraction and query engine, that generates feature descriptors - often vectors - stores them in the database layer or uses them for lookup. Furthermore, Cineast fuses results generated by different feature modules to produce the final output. Cineast can be interacted with through REST as well as gRPC.</p>\n<p>vitrivr NG: Is our user-interface written in Angular / Typescript. It offers different means of query formulation, displays results and enables exploration of results and individual items.</p>\n<p>Together, these three components make up a self-contained system for an end-to-end multimedia retrieval experience. In addition to supporting various media types, the stack also offers support for different query modes such as Query-by-Example, Query-by-Sketch, Text-based queries etc. The modular nature of the stack allows for easy extension on many different levels and integration with machine learning methods using completely different ecosystems.</p>\n",

So, this project will allow autocompletion using \"values from external data\" and \"value dependent on\"(autocompletion where one field's value depends on what was chosen for previous fields). This auto-completion will support all the pages that match a specific category, Cargo field, SMW property, or SMW concept. This autocompletion will be implemented with WikiMedia's OOUI which will help in maintaining consistency across all other extensions too.</p>\n",

Also, there are two major versions available currently: 12.10.5 - the stable release and 13.2 - the active latest release. Cloud computing has gained significant recognition in the past few years due to the availability of a virtually unlimited number of servers and unlimited power/memory availability within seconds while maintaining a pay-per-use model for billing. As companies and users move to Cloud-based solutions for their server needs, it makes sense that XWiki too should integrate seamlessly with major cloud provider solutions. Currently, Amazon’s AWS has the greatest market share in the Cloud Market, which is greater than the combined market share of Google (GCP) and Microsoft (Azure). Therefore we need to provide AMIs and Cloudformation Templates (in the context of AWS), which end users can consume directly to spin up XWiki within minutes and start testing/working.</p>\n",

Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and much more -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 700 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its extensive developer documentation (150,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application. Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of one or more major components by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot about how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",

Another key feature that many apps use today include deep linking which allows the app to open using web links directly on the screen the user desires.
