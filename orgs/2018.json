      "description_html": "<p>The 3D Toolkit is a collection of programs that allow working with 3D point cloud data. The tools include a powerful and efficient 3D point cloud viewer called \"show\" which is able to open point clouds containing millions of points even on older graphics cards while still providing high frame rates. It provides bindings for ROS, the Robotic Operating System and for Python, the programming language. Most of the functionality of 3DTK is provided in the form of \"tools\", hence the name which are executed on the command line. These tools are able to carry out operations like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM), plane detection, transformations, surface normal computation, feature detection and extraction, collision detection and dynamic object removal. We support Linux, Windows and MacOS. 3DTK contains the implementation of several complex algorithms like multiple SLAM and ICP implementations as well as several data structures like k-d trees, octrees, sphere quadtrees and voxel grids. The software is home of the implementation of algorithms from several high impact research papers. While the Point Cloud Library (PCL) might be dead, 3DTK is alive and actively maintained by an international team of skilled researchers from all over the world, ranging from Europe to China. Know-how from 3DTK influenced several businesses from car manufacturers to mineral excavation or archaeological projects.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<h3>The Problem</h3>\n<p>The Universal Space Operations Center is a simple and easy-to-use ground station for space projects. It was initially developed to aid students in their space experiments. Since no experiment is the same, there was a need to create an application that adapted to each project’s needs. In it’s current state, the user has to use a configuration file to state what protocols/variables/graphs he is going to use during his experiment. However, the need to change the application’s layout is evident, and the student should not be forced to close the ground station, change the configuration file again, and re-open the application to resume his experiment. This goes against the initial principle of the groundstation.</p>\n<h3>The Solution</h3>\n<p>There needs to be a way for the user to quickly and easily adapt the groundstation to his experiment, without having to worry too much about it. The goal of this project is to implement a set of new features that allow the user to manipulate the Ground Station’s data and layout. In order to accomplish this, I plan on creating a tool that allows the end user to specify exactly how he want his station to look and work.</p>\n",

Major users of such data are fishermen or sailors. They need to know the positions of dangerous storms, hurricanes etc and allow them to move away from them. Generally, the weather images can be downloaded from the internet, but the ships rarely have an internet connection. Hence for this, one of the solutions is that NOAA weather satellites freely send the weather images and data down to earth continuously. This is perfect for us, the users can simply have a simple and cheap RTL-SDR device and capture this freely available weather data. Currently, this is possible, but there are no opensource tools that come with the complete package. Usually, one software is used to capture and demodulate FM and then the decoded audio is fed into the other software to decode the image. This complex procedure needs a human's manual input and the raw IQ file may be lost in the process. This project intends to solve this. The open source tool that will be developed will have all the required functionalities.</p>\n",

Its core mission is to provide individuals and small studios with a complete, reliable, fully open rendering package.</p>\n<p>Over the years appleseed has been used on several projects including <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/81199785\" target=\"_blank\">TV documentaries</a>, ads, promotional videos and <a href=\"http://www.fetchaveryshortfilm.com/\" target=\"_blank\">an animation short</a>.</p>\n<h3>Features</h3>\n<p>appleseed implements a modern workflow based on path tracing that enables artifact-free, single pass rendering with very little technical tuning. It is simultaneously capable of strictly unbiased rendering when total accuracy matters, and biased rendering when artistic freedom and shorter rendering time are paramount.</p>\n<p>appleseed supports fully programmable shading via <a href=\"https://github.com/imageworks/OpenShadingLanguage\" target=\"_blank\">Sony Pictures Imageworks' Open Shading Language</a>, RGB and spectral rendering, fast and robust transformation and deformation motion blur, state-of-the-art ray traced subsurface scattering, exhaustive Python and C++ APIs and many other production-oriented features.</p>\n<p>Along with the core renderer, the team is actively developing high quality integrations into Autodesk Maya, Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender. appleseed is also the default rendering engine of <a href=\"http://www.gafferhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Image Engine’s Gaffer</a>.</p>\n",

Firstly, the addition of per vertex attributes to the curves primitive in order to create a more robust hair fibre curve representation. Secondly, the creation of a hair binary file format to import hair geometry from popular modelling softwares and export the format for ease of data flow in production. It will also support conversion from different binary hair file formats to the new native format. Finally, the addition of an advanced hair shading model that is tuned for production rendering. It is a physically based hair shader that captures the effects of the light scattering through hair fibres. The model is importance sampled and also has various parameters to change physical properties in the hair like refractive index and colour absorption and distribution. This project will fix one of the main deficiencies of the appleseed renderer and help the renderer challenge other production renderers for the mantle of the best.</p>\n",

This approach works well when the multicopter is flying at high altitudes without obstructions. In case of low altitude flights though, it becomes difficult for the drone to navigate autonomously and requires sensors to restrain it from colliding with the obstacles around. This is done by locally dividing the regions around the multicopter into sectors and scaling the attitude proportional to the distance from obstacles. This would sometimes lead to the vehicle to stop and a manual intervention would be required to let it out of the obstruction.</p>\n<p>Situations like these could be avoided if a planning algorithm could take advantage of the observations made previously in the form of a 3D map and use it to direct the multicopter in the collision free path maintaining the global plan for waypoint navigation. This could be done by building a framework for mapping which would utilize depth information from stereo cameras or lidars and generate an occupancy map. The planner would use this map and global plan as an input and generate control commands for the multicopter to navigate autonomously.</p>\n",

To this end, one of the resources used by the Riak team is <a href=\"https://github.com/basho/riak_test\" target=\"_blank\">riak_test</a>. Its main function is to provide a test running framework that overlaps significantly with Common Test, but it also contains cluster management and code intercept functionalities. We propose to break up this repository into its discrete components, making important contributions to the Erlang community and adapting the test runner framework into Common Test suites, vastly increasing the reporting ability of current Riak tests.</p>\n",

Keras uses <em>Tensorflow</em> as a backend for doing all the ML. Using Native Implemented Functions (NIF) and the Tensorflow C API as a backend, a low-level wrapper will be written in Elixir. This low-level API will then be used to write a Keras-like framework in the form of a high-level API. This will allow Elixir developers to write expedient and efficient machine learning code in Elixir.</p>\n",

This means giving users a set of tools and libraries that enables them to develop rich, native user interfaces, and deploy them to their devices, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Tools to enable Python to run on different devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to package a Python project so it can run on those devices,</li>\n<li>Libraries to access the native capabilities of devices,</li>\n<li>Tools to help develop, debug, and deploy these projects.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Python native</h3>\n<p>If Python isn't available as a first-class option on a platform, we'll do whatever is necessary to make Python available as a development language. And when we have the opportunity to embrace Python idiom for an API or a design, we're going to do just that.</p>\n<h3>Platform native</h3>\n<p>It's easy to use themes to achieve cross-platform. However, it's easy to spot apps that have been built using themes - they're the ones that don't behave quite like any other app. BeeWare uses native widgets and native functionality, rather than using a theme-based approach to application development. We also distribute our tools and libraries using platform-native distribution channels, such as app stores.</p>\n<h3>More than just code</h3>\n<p>We're not just about software, though. We also aim to be a project with a social conscience. We aim to develop and maintain a diverse and inclusive community, and we have a Code of Conduct that is rigorously enforced. We also aspire to develop a healthy and sustainable community - one that is aware of mental health issues of its participants, and provides the resources for people to start engaging, and continue to engage with the community.</p>\n",

It also gave me in-depth knowledge about the kernel development and using present technologies to build future ideas. Linux XIA gives ample opportunities to improve and take charge in the process. After successfully completing the program the team trusted me to take a more challenging role as a mentor. Their belief motivated me to work harder and deliver more to my mentees.

As a result, various inference can be carried on huge sample sizes at a reasonable computation cost.

The key problem is how to recover the frequency spectrum accurately, so several experiments would be carried out to tune parameters and implementations. Also, a framework is expected to be developed for balancing the trade off between computational complexity and data recovery accuracy, that is, deciding which kind of data should be computed with approximation and which should be computed directly.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>The Catrobat project develops useful frameworks to create games, animations, or apps easily within a short time. This set of creativity tools for smartphones, tablets, and browsers is inspired by the well-known Scratch framework by the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab.\nThe motivation behind the project is that programming is an important cultural technique on the same level as mathematics and physics, from a practical as well as from a philosophical point of view. Our aim thus is to popularize the skills needed to program from an early age on in a fun and engaging way that will facilitate the spread of its adoption among young people all over the world.\nOur awarded Android app “Pocket Code” is currently the most famous outcome of the project. Without the need of any further devices, users have the possibility to create their first program directly on their mobile device in a “Lego-like” style with blocks in just a few steps. Pocket Code supports all common device sensors, provides special bricks for different robotic devices (Lego Mindstorms, Robotix Phiro,...) as well as for hardware devices such as the Arduino board or the Raspberry Pi, and of course offers elements of programming languages such as variables, if-statements, concurrency, etc.\nWe also work on frameworks for other OS and on making it available on browsers. That’s why developers of different fields help us to keep our products up to date to the current needs of the users. Motivated by prizes (such as the Lovie Award, the Austrian National Innovation Award or the Re-Imagine Education Award) and being featured by different programs (like Google Play for Education or code.org) our team is working on many different subprojects and extensions which will be released in the coming years. Over 500 developers already contributed to our project on different topics such as App-Development, Web-Technologies, Graphics, Usability, Internationalization, or Design.</p>\n",

Lots of business logic is currently untested, or tested via UI since so many of those nearly unmockable God Objects are used there. To remedy this, those classes should be broken up into smaller classes with a clearly defined responsibilities, as well as their usages reevaluated and refactored as well. Existing unit tests are to be refactored and new tests of formerly hard to test parts are to be written.\nA good example is the Formula object in catrobat, since it is pure business logic, but currently calls a number of singletons and needs a context which can be refactored quite easily and have unit tests put in place.</p>\n",

There's plenty of tools to manage audio/video, but when it comes to subtitles, the few tools that exist are closed source and extremely expensive. CCExtractor is the one tool that is free, portable, open source and community managed that can take a recording from a TV show and generate an external subtitle file for it. If you regularly watch content with subtitles you download from fan sites - you should know that the source file is most likely generated by CCExtractor. If you are a student in a university that uses subtitles for natural language study, you should know that most likely we are involved somehow. While we already support subtitles from North America, Europe, Australia and more, our world map is not yet complete. We are actively looking for students that want to help us fill the gaps. We also want to automate many of the processes that are currently done manually, such as achieving perfect sync, or word by word (karaoke like) sync.</p>\n",

The HEP Software Foundation (<a href=\"http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/\" target=\"_blank\">http://hepsoftwarefoundation.org/</a>) facilitates the coordination of common international efforts in high-energy physics software and computing.</p>\n<p>CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research, <a href=\"http://www.cern.ch\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.cern.ch</a>) has participated in GSoC since 2011 as the CERN-SFT group, which provides common software for CERN's experiments. In 2017, the program expanded to include many software projects from the whole field of high-energy physics. The vast majority of our GSoC projects do not require any physics knowledge.</p>\n<p>The experiments at CERN, such as the Large Hadron Collider, the world’s largest and most powerful particle accelerator (<a href=\"http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider\" target=\"_blank\">http://home.cern/topics/large-hadron-collider</a>) try to answer fundamental questions about the Universe. For example, what is the nature of mass? What are the elementary building blocks of the Universe? What was the early Universe like? What is the nature of dark matter and dark energy? Why is there an asymmetry between matter and antimatter? In 2012, LHC experiments announced the discovery of a new particle, the Higgs Boson, that helps explain how particles obtain mass. Also, CERN is the birthplace of the World Wide Web. Today, particle physicists are working on analyzing the data from the experiments to study the properties of the newly discovered particle and to search for new physics, such as dark matter or extra dimensions. This requires a lot of sophisticated software.</p>\n<p>The open-source high-energy physics projects to which students can contribute during GSoC span many high-energy physics software projects: data analysis, detector and accelerator simulation, event reconstruction, data management and many others. We look forward to your contributions!</p>\n",

It therefore makes GANs immensely useful in simulation of particle physics and astrophysical data.</p>\n<p>Since ROOT is a data analysis tool extensively used for applications in particle physics and features a dedicated machine learning submodule, Toolkit for Multivariate Analysis (TMVA), it is essential to include a GAN implementation in the toolkit.</p>\n<p>My project would focus on integrating an optimized GAN implementation in the TMVA DNN library with the help of already existing implementations of Deep Network Models.

Spark3D would provide the set of out-of-the-box 3D Spatial RDD (3D SRDD) to partition the data across machines.\nUltimately, Spark3D would be available as an open-source library which works with all recent versions of the Spark (2.0+), has user friendly APIs (in Scala, Java and Python), works on top of all major platforms out of the box (HDFS, S3, Cassandra, etc.) and supports all major file formats (CSV, Parquet, JSON, Avro, etc.) including popular scientific file formats such as FITS.</p>\n",

Its goal is to facilitate in-depth studies of silicon-based particle and radiation detectors widely used in high-energy physics. During simulation, Allpix-Squared run events that contains a series of modules that operate on input data — usually in the form of a previous module’s output data. These events aim to mirror the behavior of a particle interacting with a specific detector hardware. Some modules are independent of others, so they can be run in parallel; this is the current state of the multithreading used in the framework, but it does not make good use of available CPU cores. The aim of this proposal is thus to run full events in parallel instead, greatly enhancing CPU core utilization. This however requires some internal restructure and presents new problems not shared with the current approach, such as the issue of event execution order. I aim to solve this issue with dependency graphs. When done, the new multithreading approach should allow better execution time, independent on core count and simulation parameters.</p>\n",

During my preliminary work with the codebase, I discovered that the current package's public interface can be further improved. Since performing this change can significantly reduce the complexity of my main task, as well as any future extensions to the package, I plan to work on it during the first phase of the summer period. The first part of the present proposal goes through the necessary changes to achieve a clean API. The rest of the proposal iterates through the main modules that need to be ported into the GPU implementation. These are the different layer types that can be included in a convolutional neural network, as well as a number of generic helper functions. Attention is drawn on guaranteeing the deliverable's quality, both in terms of correctness and in terms of speed-up. This will be achieved through extensive testing and standardized benchmarking respectively.</p>\n",

To achieve this, a Lightweight Sites Specification document has been created that will allow the software configuration of the entire site through a central module. This would be the Level 1 configuration. In addition, other Lightweight Sites Components would be created according to specifications. One such component includes the repositories for containers of different compute elements (CE), batch systems, worker nodes (WN), etc. These containers are also configured and comprise the Level 2 configurations. In the past, YAIM, an in-house configuration tool has been used for Level 2 configurations.

      "description_html": "<p>We are a group of developers who are passionate about code quality.  We have built an innovative lightweight verification tool called the <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Checker Framework</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework helps you prevent bugs at development time, before they escape to production.  It is based on the idea of <em>pluggable type-checking</em>.  Pluggable type-checking replaces a programming language's built-in type system with a more powerful, expressive one.</p>\n<p>Java's type system prevents some bugs, such as <code>int count = \"hello\";</code>.  However, it does not prevent other bugs, such as null pointer dereferences, concurrency errors, disclosure of private information, incorrect internationalization, out-of-bounds indices, etc.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework enables you to create a more powerful type system and use it in place of Java's.  The more powerful type system is not just a bug-finding tool:  it is a verification tool that gives a guarantee that no errors (of certain types) exist in your program.  Even though it is powerful, it is easy to use.  It follows the standard typing rules that programmers already know, and it fits into their workflow.  We have created around 20 <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#introduction\" target=\"_blank\">new type systems</a>, and other people have created <a href=\"https://checkerframework.org/manual/#third-party-checkers\" target=\"_blank\">many more</a>.</p>\n<p>The Checker Framework is popular:  it is successfully used on hundreds of projects at Google, Amazon, Uber, on Wall Street, and in other companies from big to small.  It it attractive to programmers who care about their craft and the quality of their code.  The Checker Framework is the motivation for Java's type annotations feature.  Talks on it have received multiple awards at conferences such as JavaOne.  With this widespread use, there is a need for people to help with the project:  everything from bug fixes, to new features, to case studies, to IDE integration.

The 2 major steps involved are:</p>\n<pre><code>* experimenting with various anomaly detection techniques to figure out which one provides a required balance of precision (% of detected frauds which are actually fraudulent) and recall (% of all frauds detected);\n* providing the technique as an independent web service to WMF (like ORES) which can entertain requests to ascertain the authenticity of transactions.\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Stretch Goals</strong></p>\n<pre><code>* The web service uses the feedback from its decisions (new correct detection/wrong detection corrected by a human) to train the underlying model, improving its accuracy in the future.\n* Use something like LIME to provide a justification as to why our classifier chose to mark a transaction as fraud.\n* CiviCRM extension to interface directly with the web service.\n</code></pre>\n",

I've been rewriting the open-source canvassing app, Field The Bern, to be independent of Bernie infrastructure, and think it's a great candidate for CiviCRM integration.

It is doing so by removing barriers to entry for those doing natural language processing (NLP) in Classical languages (namely, the surviving literature of the entirety of Eurasia and north Africa, from roughly 3000 B.C. to A.D. 1500).</p>\n<p>Due to how academic disciplines have evolved over the past 200 years, our earliest civilizations are often studied in isolation from one another. This is tragic, for today we know that the ancient world – from Rome to Mesopotamia to India to China – consisted of deeply interconnected networks of ideas, technologies, art, and beliefs. As a framework for multidisciplinary research, the CLTK will help scholars discover the commonalities of what were once thought disparate cultures.</p>\n<p>As software, the CLTK is a suite of NLP tools suited to the special needs of ancient languages. We have have three goals: The most basic is to offer low-level libraries for doing NLP in particular Classical languages (e.g., Ancient Greek, Sanskrit). Developed with an extensible architecture, our code is easily hacked to support new languages. Second, the CLTK offers tools for students and scholars to do reproducible scientific research. For instance, it has version-controlled linguistic corpora and a suite of functions for stylometrics. Third, it is a framework for multidisciplinary language research. With pre-trained models (such as Word2Vec for vector space models), we provide easy-to-use tools to capture the transmission and evolution of knowledge, from the earliest human societies to the dawn of the modern era.</p>\n",

Lemmatization is the process by which inflected word-forms are grouped together under their dictionary headings.

However the CLTK lemmatizer is not currently able to identify synonyms for a given word, or suggest translations into other languages.</p>\n<p>I propose to modify the existing CLTK lemmatizer to look up synonyms and translations for Latin and Greek. I will adapt CLTK’s unique ‘backoff’ approach to lemmatization in order to measure the probability of each possible synonym and/or translation for a target word given its context. Further, I propose to incorporate vector models for Latin and Greek based on word embeddings trained using the word2vec algorithm. Once synonyms, translations, and vector models are incorporated into CLTK, users will be able to perform cutting-edge tasks like sentence length document alignment. This will open new horizons for digitally assisted classical scholarship.</p>\n",

Furthermore, CLiPS is well known for its work on computational stylometry and has developed state-of-the-art technology for authorship attribution, as well as author profiling, i.e. the detection of personality, age and gender of the author of a text, based on personal writing style. Another line of research at CLiPS focuses on computational psycholinguistics and researches psychologically plausible models of child language acquisition and bilinguality. CLiPS also researches and develops tools for biomedical text mining.</p>\n<p>Over the years, CLiPS has established a strong reputation in the application of machine learning methods on a variety of language technology problems for a wide range of languages. To capitalize on this reputation, a spin-off company, Textgain (textgain.com), was founded in 2015 that aims to bring CLiPS technology to the market for commercial purposes.</p>\n",

At CloudCV, we are building tools that enable researchers to build, compare, and share start-of-the-algorithms. We believe that one shouldn’t have to be an AI expert to have access to cutting-edge vision algorithms. Likewise, researchers shouldn’t have to worry about building a service around their deep learning models to showcase and share it with others.</p>\n<p>CloudCV consists of three major platforms:</p>\n<p><strong>Origami</strong> is an AI-as-a-service solution that allows researchers to easily convert their deep learning models into an online service that is widely accessible to everyone without the need to set up infrastructure, resolve dependencies, and build a web service around the deep learning model. By lowering the barrier to entry to the latest AI algorithms, we provide developers, researchers, and students the ability to access any model using a simple REST API call.</p>\n<p><strong>Fabrik</strong> is an online collaborative platform to build, visualize and train deep learning models by a simple drag-and-drop approach. It allows researchers to collaboratively develop and debug models using a web GUI that allows importing, editing, and exporting networks from widely popular frameworks like Caffe, Tensorflow and Keras.</p>\n<p><strong>EvalAI</strong> is an open source web platform that aims to help researchers, students and data scientists create, collaborate, and participate in AI challenges. In recent years, it has become increasingly difficult to compare an algorithm solving a given task with other existing approaches. These comparisons suffer from minor differences in algorithm implementation, use of non-standard dataset splits, and different evaluation metrics. By simplifying and standardizing the process of benchmarking AI, we want to circumvent many of the factors impeding the rate of progress in AI.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>coala: Language Independent Code Analysis</p>\n<p>coala provides a common command-line interface for linting and fixing all your code, regardless of the programming languages you use. It allows users to analyse projects containing multiple languages with just one tool, using just one configuration and seeing just one user interface.</p>\n<h3>How does it work?</h3>\n<p>With coala, you create just one configuration file. It can be separated into sections that run independently to fit different scenarios. Using different bears (which are coala's modules) users can work with a wide range of existing tools, wrapped by bears, and native analysis routines. This enables users to check their python code for pep8 conformity, calculate complexity for their java code, find code duplicates in the C code and check the documentation for spelling errors, while making sure the commits follow the set guidelines. All controlled via one configuration file, run with one command and served in the same user interface.</p>\n<h3>For Users</h3>\n<p>coala offers a unified static code analysis suite. It can be used as a simple standalone testing suite, pre-commit hook and CI tool. Besides the normal user interactive mode, there is a non interactive mode for CI, a html output mode, to view results in the browser, and JSON output if you want to integrate coala into your own system. If implemented, coala even offers to automatically fix problems.</p>\n<h3>For Developers</h3>\n<p>You can easily write your own bears. coala is written with ease of extension in mind. That means: no big boilerplate, just write one small object with one routine, add the parameters you like and see how coala automates the organisation of settings, user interaction and execution parallelisation.</p>\n<h3>For Newcomers</h3>\n<p>coala offers a great newcomer experience with an in depth step by step guide for your first contribution, extensive documentation of the whole workflow and fast and easy communication over the gitter channel.</p>\n",

One of the main interests of our group is the development of technologies to make large-scale computational approaches accessible and more collaborative to a wider scientific audience. Our recent web-based technology, Cell Collective, enables scientists from across the globe to construct and simulate large-scale computational models of biological systems in a highly collaborative fashion. This software enables biomedical researchers to study the dynamics of biological systems (e.g., cells) under both healthy and diseased conditions. Cell Collective provides a unique environment for real-time, interactive simulations to enable users to analyze and visualize the multitude of effects a disease-related malfunction can have on the rest of the cell. Over the last couple of years, Cell Collective has also made its way into classrooms, where students in life sciences courses can learn about biological processes by building, simulating, breaking, and re-building computational models of these processes. Cell Collective now supports about 2,000 students/year in introductory life sciences courses in 10+ universities.</p>\n<p>Other technologies developed by our organization include cost-effective mobile disease monitoring devices, interactive on-line tissue sample analysis, an interactive statistical analysis platform for teaching life sciences students about data analysis, etc.</p>\n<p>Our group consists of computer scientists, biochemists, biologists, bioinformaticians, as well as mathematicians, creating an unique environment of diverse skills, integrated by a single interest point.</p>\n",

However an instant messaging client in a federated ecosystem like Jabber is only as good as the rest of the ecosystem. The ecosystem needs good desktop clients, it needs good servers and good providers who maintain their servers and keep them up to date with the latest features. Conversations.im as an umbrella organization is about bringing improvements to that ecosystem. Partially by improving existing clients and servers but also by creating tools that aid server administrators to maintain their servers and that aid end users to pick a good, stable provider. Those tools include the XMPP Compliance Tester or the XMPP uptime monitor. We have a <a href=\"https://conversations.im/gsoc.html\" target=\"_blank\">collection of ideas</a> that we think will improve the end user experience, but we are also very open to hearing other ideas that we didn’t think of ourself. Have you always thought about creating a service that will look up phone numbers and return Jabber IDs or otherwise improve the discoverable of contacts? Great. Let us hear your ideas and we might be able to find a suitable mentor for you. Want to add a new feature to an existing client? Great we will put you in touch with the appropriate mentors. Want to start developing your own client? Probably not a very good idea since every platform already has a client that awaits your help.</p>\n",

Our data are available publicly at <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu</a> and our audiences comprise primarily scholars and students, but with growing numbers of informal learners.</p>\n<p>At the heart of cdli is a group of developers, language scientists, machine learning engineers, and cuneiform specialists who develop software infrastructure to process and analyze curated data. To this effect, we are actively developing two projects: Framework Update <a href=\"https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli.ucla.edu/?q=news/cdli-core-update</a> and Machine Translation and Automated Analysis of Cuneiform Languages <a href=\"https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/\" target=\"_blank\">https://cdli-gh.github.io/mtaac/</a>. As part of these projects we are building a natural language processing platform to empower specialists of ancient languages for undertaking automated annotation and translation of Sumerian language texts thus enabling data driven study of languages, culture, history, economy and politics of the ancient Near Eastern civilizations. As part of this platform we are focusing on data standardization using Linked Open Data to foster best practices in data exchange and integration with other digital humanities and computational philology projects.</p>\n",

We will then evaluate our system using existing architectures available for semantic role labeling with the projected SRL data. The final system also involves the production of word embeddings for Sumerian which can be documented and used for improving other downstream tasks like POS tagging, dependency parsing, etc. The developed SRL system will have many potential applications, viz. in the fields of document summarization, machine translation and also towards a better abstract semantic representation of the originally sparse textual data.</p>\n",

This structured information resembles an open knowledge graph (KG) which is available for everyone on the Web. A knowledge graph is a special kind of database which stores knowledge in a machine-readable form and provides a means for information to be collected, organised, shared, searched and utilised. Google uses a similar approach to create those knowledge cards during search.</p>\n<p>DBpedia currently describes 38.3 million “things” of 685 different “types” in 125 languages, with over 3 billion “facts” (September 2014). It is interlinked to many other databases (e.g., Wikidata, New York Times, CIA World Factbook). The knowledge in DBpedia is exposed through a set of technologies called Linked Data. Started in 2006, DBpedia is one of the first (if not THE first) open knowledge graph on the Web. DBpedia provides tools that allow you to create, maintain, improve, integrate and use KGs to build applications, e.g. BBC has created the World Cup 2010 website by interconnecting textual content and facts from their knowledge base. Data provided by DBpedia was greatly involved in creating this knowledge graph. More recently, IBM's Watson used DBpedia data to win the Jeopardy challenge. Several other large, medium and small companies use data from DBpedia everyday.</p>\n<p>DBpedia data is served as Linked Data, which is revolutionizing the way applications interact with the Web. One can navigate this Web of facts with standard Web browsers, automated crawlers or pose complex queries with SQL-like query languages (e.g. SPARQL). Have you thought of asking the Web about all cities with low criminality, warm weather and open jobs? That's the kind of query we are talking about.</p>\n<p>We are regularly growing our community through GSoC and can deliver more and more opportunities to you.</p>\n",

While we do this, it is imperative that these embeddings are able to accommodate the semantic relatedness between entities. This means that we are not limiting ourselves with just the similarity between words, instead we take a step further ahead to also define the relatedness between the vectors and thus the relation between the entities and the text. Therefore, to incorporate this measure of the semantic distance, we define a measure of descriptiveness of the class that these entities belong to. Entities belonging to a class that has a very high level of description must have very low semantic distance in our model. Eventually, we extend the usability by predicting embeddings for out-of-vocabulary entities as well, and also extract relations between those entities using approaches that have been previously used for link prediction tasks in machine learning.</p>\n",

To deal with that, better accurate machine learning approaches, such as Deep Learning (DL), are needed to transform raw data into applicable Information. Several DL architectures (e.g. CNN, semantic segmentation) rely only at spatial dimension to perform, for example, land-cover/land-use (LCLU) maps, disregarding the temporal dependencies between pixels observations over the time. Also, high-res remote sensing data (e.g. Planet, Sentinel) may provide more consistent time-series, that can be use in the identification of important LCLU classes, like crop, pastureland and grasslands.</p>\n<p>This potential can be explored using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), a specific family of DL approaches which can take into account time dimension. A promising project idea would be implement a RNN approach (e.g. LSTM) to classify a Sentinel time-series that is able to produce a map for one or more LCLU classes and ship the final version of the model into the Pycoal library as part of the COAL project.</p>\n",

Automated analysis for such data can simplify the development process, by enabling an ffi-generator to generate bindings for Java , ideally without requiring any manual input from the developer. Since the project is mostly exploratory, the analysis is intended to be conservative, but never wrong, in the sense that it should not recommend a return type of <code>a</code> for a function that may return <code>null</code>, but may recommend <code>Maybe a</code> for a function that never returns <code>null</code>.

Its goal is to “create a Fedora Edition for Internet of Things, which will make Fedora the default for open source innovation on IoT hardware, middleware and backend platforms”.\nMany IoT devices have special requirements for operation and automation. Among these is the requirement to not break upon operating system upgrades. As part of Fedora IoT, Peter Robinson ideated the Atomic Host Upgrade Daemon, which builds on the Atomic Project and rpm-ostree, a project also labeled “Git for Operating Systems”. This monitoring daemon will re-use the work done for Atomic Updates for IoT system, allowing for automatic checking for available upgrades, applying them, rebooting, checking the system status and, in case of errors, rolling back the changes.</p>\n",

The present testing suite requires some more tests for the functionalities like direct linking of tracks and rooms so the aim is to write <strong>mocha unit tests</strong> with selenium webdriver for the recently added features and the proposed ones. The travis build for the selenium tests run for around 20 minutes, which is quite large so the aim is to <strong>parallelize the build</strong> so that multiple builds can be performed at the same time and runtime can be decreased significantly.</p>\n",

Such hardware designs can for example be single \"IP blocks\" or entire system-on-chip (SoC). Our vision is that there will be multiple open source chips in the next years. Our main effort is our community hub website <a href=\"https://librecores.org\" target=\"_blank\">LibreCores.org</a>.</p>\n<p>Beside single components and entire SoCs, we see open source Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tools as a crucial for the advance of FOSSi. We therefore encourage and support open source synthesis tools, simulators and system generators, just to mention a few.</p>\n<p>With those activities we are steadily working on advancing FOSSi and make it the next success after Open Source Software and (tangible) Open Source Hardware. We are open to proposals that help us getting in the direction of \"open source chips\". Please find a list of a few ideas, and we highly encourage you to think beyond that.</p>\n<p>Google Summer of Code students are invited to present and demonstrate their projects at our annual conference <a href=\"https://orconf.org\" target=\"_blank\">ORConf</a> with 100-200 attendants, which is held in Gdansk, Poland, on September 21-23.</p>\n",

Free UK Genealogy provides free access to historical data of interest to family historians and others. Over twenty years, thousands of volunteers have so far transcribed over 400 million records. The databases, search engines and user interfaces have largely largely designed and maintained by volunteers, who have been supported by a number of contractors and, more recently, a small team of support staff.  FreeREG uses mongodb, Ruby on Rails, and Refinery CMS.  FreeCEN is transitioning from mysql to mongodb, from php to Ruby on Rails, and does not have a CMS in its old interface (www.freecen.org.uk).</p>\n<p>For FreeREG, we are planning to use the summer to finish work on Version 1.5 Coordinator Enhancement - these are features which allow our volunteer coordinators to support the transcribers in their teams, and to monitor and maintain the quality of the transcription work.  We hope to have finished the tasks relating to the development of new communications systems (but there may be some bug fixing to do) and be working on improvements suggested by the coordinators.</p>\n<p>For FreeCEN, we are also  planning to use the summer to work on features for Coordinators - but this is at an earlier level.  Using our learning from FreeREG, we need to enable Coordinators to move on from outdated (and unstable) software for quality control, and undertake this using online tools. We are also beginning to explore how to offer the same functionality as www.freecen.org.uk (lots of ways to search!) on freecen2.freecen.org.uk - perhaps using AI.</p>\n",

This is also where our Summer of Code students have worked in previous years. We have an active mentoring program to bring all new developers into our community, not just those that we introduce to FreeBSD through the GSoC. There are hundreds of mailing lists, forums, blogs, IRC channels, and user groups all detailed on our main website. FreeBSD offers a complete operating system in which students can work, not just a kernel or specific userland stack. This allows for interesting work that spans the userland/kernel boundary.</p>\n<p>In addition to producing an operating system, FreeBSD has incubated the development of key pieces of infrastructure which are used by other open source projects including bsnmp, jemalloc, libarchive, and OpenPAM.</p>\n",

The goal of the project is to convert all the PCI drivers attachments to be table driven and mark with PNP_INFO. \nThe devmatch infrastructure gives us a way to match up hardware with kernel modules that implement drivers that claim the hardware. The problem is that the drivers need some modification before devmatch can use them. Specifically, they need to have their device ID scans done via a table, and that table needs to be decorated with a PNP_INFO tag so the compiler and kld_xref extract the metadata that devmatch needs to do this job. As the PCI drivers are all over the place in terms of how they match device IDs work will be needed to move some of the in-line code to tables, some of the tables lookups may be able to move to standardized routines, etc. Trimming GENERIC to show that the drivers work is also required.\nThere are about 243 such PCI drivers. grep -r 'DRIVER_MODULE.<em>, pci,' </em> | wc is used to find out. The plan is to convert a significant portion of them and maintain a documentation of the conversion.</p>\n",

It quickly became and remains one of the most important reference databases in genomics, following the rapid development of the field. Its initial mission included finding all of the genes in the human genome. A year later, the mouse genome was published and we developed tools to directly compare genomes across species. Over the following decade, sequencing capacity increased exponentially (faster that Moore's Law in fact) and large surveys started examining more species and more individuals within each species. Our mission therefore expanded to store these datasets and statistics efficiently. Finally, in recent years, sequencing has been used to study the biochemical activity of the DNA molecule within the different tissues of an individual, prompting us to extend yet again our remit.</p>\n<p>At the same time, Ensembl is an evolving software development project. Over 15 years, we moved from a central relational MySQL database with a Perl API and static web pages, to an array of storage technologies with a RESTful interface and an interactive front-end. We have dedicated portals for the large clades on the tree of life (known as Ensembl Genomes). Our annotations are produced through centuries of CPU time, coordinated by our powerful eHive analysis workflow manager.</p>\n<p>Today, we are a team of nearly 60 full time staff, housed at the European Bioinformatics Institute, and we collaborate with many external contributors around the world, in particular via our Github repositories where you can see us work day-to-day. We are at the intersection of two exciting and rapidly expanding fields, and there is no lack of interesting directions to push the project.</p>\n",

Identification of Gene Orthology Relation is the most important task of Comparative Genomics, as they tend to preserve similar molecular and biological functions. Thus if we can establish orthology relationships between two genes, we can obtain valuable evolutionary history of the two genes. However, with advanced sequencing depth and expansion in transcriptome data, genes are no longer the proper units for interrogation in functional conservation, evolutionary events, and expressional patterns, especially in the field of alternative splicing. As the accumulation of transcriptomic data, alternative splicing is taken into account in the assignments of gene orthologs and the orthology is suggested to be further considered at transcript level. Whether gene or transcript orthology, exons are the basic units that represent the whole gene structure; however, there is not much reported study on how to build exon level orthology in a whole genome scale. Therefore, it is essential to establish a transcription oriented gene orthology algorithm.</p>\n",

This is only possible when the tool is designed to reflect and transmit the will of the user, and leave the possibilities open as to the final form of the raw materials (the source code.)

This is backwards, and contrary to the Gentoo philosophy.</p>\n<p>Put another way, the Gentoo philosophy is to create better tools. When a tool is doing its job perfectly, you might not even be very aware of its presence, because it does not interfere and make its presence known, nor does it force you to interact with it when you don’t want it to. The tool serves the user rather than the user serving the tool.</p>\n<p>The goal of Gentoo is to strive to create near-ideal tools. Tools that can accommodate the needs of many different users all with divergent goals. Don’t you love it when you find a tool that does exactly what you want to do? Doesn’t it feel great?

A second metric could be the performance of the model in language specific tests. Last but not least, we could evaluate the model in real world data offered by Official Greek Government's Gazette (FEK-ΦΕΚ) for named entities extraction and  document categorization as mentioned in the ideas list of GFOSS for GSOC 2018.\nWith respect to sentiment analysis, I would like to implement a binary classifier that, given a piece of text in Greek language, can computationally identify and categorize  the opinions expressed and more specifically to determine whether the writer's attitude towards the topic is positive or negative. The classifier will also return a polarity score which will serve as a measure of confidence of the classifier for its’ decision.</p>\n",

Its modularity allows users to populate the framework with their own algorithms, allowing to put the focus on the signal processing implementation without worrying about how to embed that algorithm in a whole GNSS receiver. It also makes possible fair performance benchmarks using real GNSS signals, and its open source license allows free downloading, use and code inspection.\nThe proposed software receiver targets multi-constellation/multi-frequency architectures, pursuing the goals of efficiency, modularity, interoperability, and flexibility demanded by user domains that require non-standard features, such as earth observers or geodesists, and allowing applications such as the observation of the ionosphere, GNSS reflectometry, signal quality monitoring, space weather, and high-accuracy positioning based on carrier-phase navigation techniques. In this project, we focus on signal processing, understood as the process between the ADC and the computation of code and phase observables, including the demodulation of the navigation message. We purposely omit data processing, understood as the computation of the navigation solution from the observables and the navigation message, since there are a number of well-established libraries and applications for that (also in the open source side, such as GPSTk or RTKLIB).</p>\n",

It should also be able to provide the users, an easy method to select and execute the corrections suggested and enable/disable the feature. This could get tricky as Octave comes in both a GUI and a CLI. Therefore, for a successful integration of this feature with Octave, understanding how its parser, error handling, and internal functions work would be essential. The next part of the problem would be to generate the words to suggest. A trivial solution of this problem is easy but computationally expensive and hence not feasible. The challenging part therefore, is to minimize the speed-accuracy trade-off of the feature. A starting point for that would be a smart (probability based for example) implementation of the Edit-distance algorithm, using dynamic programming. Later, a Neural Network based idea would also be tested. The goal of-course, is to use the algorithm that best minimizes the speed-accuracy trade-off and provides the best UX.</p>\n",

This component should have a web interface, where payment buttons or payment forms will be configured. Additional goals include inventory management, where the seller can configure the available stock for an item and will get notified when their stock runs low.

It is widely used in research, industry, academia, government, and hobbyist environments to support both wireless communications research and real-world radio systems.</p>\n<p>In brief, a software radio is a radio system which performs the required signal processing in software instead of using dedicated integrated circuits in hardware. The benefit is that since software can be easily replaced in the radio system, the same hardware can be used to create many kinds of radios for many different communications standards; thus, one software radio can be used for a variety of applications!</p>\n<p>You can use GNU Radio to write applications to receive and transmit data with radio hardware, or to create entirely simulation-based applications. GNU Radio has filters, channel codes, synchronisation elements, equalizers, demodulators, vocoders, decoders, and many other types of blocks which are typically found in signal processing systems. More importantly, it includes a method of connecting these blocks and then manages how data is passed from one block to another. Extending GNU Radio is also quite easy; if you find a specific block that is missing, you can quickly create and add it.</p>\n<p>GNU Radio applications can be written in either C++ or Python programming language, while the performance-critical signal processing path is implemented in C++ using processor floating-point extensions where available. This enables the developer to implement real-time, high-throughput radio systems in a simple-to-use, rapid-application-development environment.</p>\n",

The WebRTC standard will be able to provide support to Godot's existing multiplayer in making these sorts of peer-to-peer games.</p>\n<p>It will also make multiplayer viable in the HTML5 target platform, and allow for easy interfacing with non-Godot peers that use WebRTC.  Additionally, the support I build for WebRTC will make it easy to later add WebRTC MediaStreams, allowing for in-game voice chat.  (However, building MediaStream is less-often needed for games so is considered to be low priority and non-essential in my project. See project proposal for details.)</p>\n",

The model-building will result in an XML specification of embryo physics that describes mosaic developmental process. This specification will be used to build trees and networks that describe relationships between individual cells. This will provide the Openworm Foundation and the larger neuroscience research community with an informatics framework for understanding neural precursor cells and developing nervous systems.

It is clear however, that the brain is active even when the subject is not performing a task. In fact, according to certain estimates, task-related changes in neuronal metabolism only account for about 5% of the brain’s total energy consumption. Resting state fMRI is a comparatively newer approach used to identify synchronous BOLD changes in multiple brain regions while the subjects lie comfortably in the scanner without performing a task. The correlations between spontaneous BOLD signals can be used to study intrinsic functional connectivity. The analysis is also useful in situations where it is advantageous to explore the brain’s functional organization in neurological or psychiatric diseases. INCF currently has a tool to retrieve the hemodynamic response function at rest from resting state fMRI, however, the code is currently written in MATLAB. In order to increase its diffusion and portability, the repository has to be converted to Python and follow the BIDS - Standards to eventually create the portable neuroimaging pipeline.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p><strong>Description of the code</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.sofa-framework.org/\" target=\"_blank\">SOFA</a> is an open-source framework for multi-physics simulation and is being developed for more than 10 years. Today, SOFA benefits from a large international community made up of research centers and companies. The SOFA core has a LGPL license (permissive and non-contaminating) fostering development of prototypes and products under any commercial license. Among the fields of application, SOFA is commonly used for:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>soft and rigid body dynamics,</li>\n<li>heat transfer,</li>\n<li>robotics</li>\n<li>and visualization.</li>\n</ul>\n<p></p>\n<p><strong>1. Coupling SOFA + Pulse</strong>\nThe objective of this project is to create an open-source plugin for SOFA building an interface with the open-source library <a href=\"http://physiology.kitware.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Pulse</a> platform. This engine provides comprehensive models for the human physiology. Both API are very close to each other: C++, Cmake, a core library with optional plugins. The integration will be helped with two mentors: one from the SOFA community and another one from the Pulse community.This project will therefore bring a new open-source technology to drive medical research, and innovation.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Emscriptening Sofa</strong>\nWe now would like to be able to execute SOFA in the browser to promote the development of simulation based web-based applications. As SOFA a implemented in C++ this is not straightforward. This project aims at adapting the core of the SOFA simulation framework so that it can be compiled with Emscripten. Emscripten is a compiler that takes C/C++ code and compiles it to efficient subsets of JavaScript as asm.js and webassembly.</p>\n<p><strong>3. Communication protocols in SOFA</strong>\nThe purpose of this project is to improve the communication plugin by adding more protocols in it such as vrpn, serial bus communication, and also improve the way it works. This plugin has an abstract base to run and implement different protocols asynchronously to the main sofa-framework thread. In a near future it has to be the default base for communicating with SOFA.</p>\n<p><strong>Contact</strong>\n<a href=\"https://www.sofa-framework.org/consortium/contact/\" target=\"_blank\">Hugo Talbot, coordinator for SOFA at the Inria Foundation</a></p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>What is InterMine?</h3>\n<p>InterMine integrates data from different biological sources, providing a web-based user interface for querying and analysing the data. Users can automatically generate code to run queries using our <a href=\"http://intermine.readthedocs.io/en/latest/web-services/#api-and-client-libraries\" target=\"_blank\">client libraries in R, Python, Perl, Ruby, Java, and Javascript</a>.</p>\n<h4>What technologies do we use?</h4>\n<p>InterMine core is built in Java, and all data are stored in PostgreSQL. We have a legacy JSP-based user interface, with a Clojurescript user interface in early beta. We're also keen on browser-based datavis tools that use of our API, so you'll see a lot of Javascript (or languages that compile to Javascript, like Clojurescript and Coffeescript). Our client libraries provide opportunities to write code in several other languages.</p>\n<h4>What sort of data does InterMine have?</h4>\n<p>Since InterMine is open source, many research organisations around the world run InterMines with their own data, ranging from mice and fruit flies to a broad range of plants. Visit the <a href=\"http://registry.intermine.org/\" target=\"_blank\">InterMine Registry</a> to see them all. (The registry was written by a GSoC student last year!) Most InterMines also have a \"data sources\" tab which tells you more about where the data in that specific instance originates.</p>\n<h4>What kind of problems does InterMine solve?</h4>\n<p>Genomic data is often messy, and there is a lot of it. Scientists use different terms to mean the same thing, and even assign the same gene different names! How can we handle this ambiguity? How can we help the end user make sense of data that is so diverse and complex? \nOne way to help scientists analyse data is to provide visualisations, so we’re always excited to add and adapt different ways to display our data. How do you visualise the features inside a protein, or the interactions between two sets of genes? \nCode you write for InterMine can have a large impact - since there are dozens of different InterMines, you can often write code to work with one InterMine and with little or no effort, port it to another InterMine with different data.</p>\n",

ISC provides the same leadership both in standards development and software for the DHCP protocol: <strong>ISC DHCP</strong> and <strong>Kea</strong>. Over the years, the ISC team has written over <a href=\"https://www.isc.org/community/rfcs/isc-rfcs/\" target=\"_blank\">60 RFCs</a>; we are proud of our substantial contributions to the <a href=\"http://ietf.org\" target=\"_blank\">Internet Engineering Task Force</a>.</p>\n<p>Administrators adopting Kea are looking for new ways to manage their core network services. They are attracted by Kea's separation of lease data from network communications, that facilitates centralized provisioning. They want to leverage Kea's hooks api and REST api to integrate DHCP with other network operations. As the explosion of containerized applications is breaking the old 1:1 relationship of IP addresses to machines, they need more flexibility and automation for services like DNS updating. The Kea team are looking for contributors who want to help us bring this core network management service into the 21st century by improving and extending the monitoring, provisioning, extensibility and performance.</p>\n<p>ISC is a non-profit company. Our open source software is freely available on our website and on <a href=\"github\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/isc-projects</a>.

These domains include sensors, actuators, and intelligent software in between. It has been designed to help in programming such intelligent\nsoftware. It is written in C++, Python and JavaScript, and provides a distributed component-based programming environment where the robotic application is made up of a collection of several concurrent asynchronous components. Each component may run in different computers and they are connected using ICE\ncommunication middleware or ROS. JdeRobot is based on ROS and uses ROS drivers.</p>\n<p>Real robots like TurtleBot, drones (ArDrone, 3DR solo) and real sensors like color cameras, RGBD cameras (Kinect1, Kinect2, Xtion), RPLidar, laser are supported. And their corresponding ones in Gazebo simulator, including also a Formula1 and autonomous cars.</p>\n<p>Getting sensor measurements is as simple as calling a local function, and ordering motor commands as easy as calling another local function. The platform attaches those calls to the remote invocation on the components connected to the sensor\nor the actuator devices. Those local functions build the Hardware Abstraction Layer API. The robotic application gets the sensor readings and orders the actuator commands using such HAL to unfold its behavior.</p>\n<p>JdeRobot include many tools: (a) JdeRobot-Academy, a suite for teaching robotics and computer vision, with 20 motivating exercises; (b) VisualStates, for visual creation of automata that control robot behavior; (c) Scratch2JdeRobot, for programming advanced robots with a full visual language; (d) robot teleoperators, even with web technologies; (e) a tuner for color filters, etc.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Jitsi is a set of open-source projects that allows you to easily build and deploy secure videoconferencing solutions. At the heart of Jitsi are Jitsi Videobridge and Jitsi Meet, which let you have conferences on the internet, while other projects in the community enable other features such as audio, dial-in, recording, and simulcasting.</p>\n<p>Jitsi Desktop (previously SIP Communicator) is an audio/video and chat communicator written in Java. It supports protocols such as SIP, XMPP,  Bonjour, etc. It implements a rich set of communications features such as Video calls and conferences with SIP and XMPP Jingle on Linux, macOS, and Windows, call transfers, call encryption and many others. \nThe Jitsi family, and hence our GSoC project ideas, also include other projects such as \nice4j.org - An ICE protocol implementation for robust NAT and firewall traversal (<a href=\"http://ice4j.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://ice4j.org</a>)\nlibjitsi - A rich audio/video media stack written in Java (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/libjitsi\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/libjitsi</a>)\nJitsi Videobridge - A video relaying server that, together with Jitsi allows for multi-party video calls similar to the ones we do with Google Hangouts (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/videobridge\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/videobridge</a>)\nJitsi Meet - A WebRTC JavaScript application for videoconferencing, which uses XMPP Jingle for signalling and Jitsi Videobridge as a server-side media router. (<a href=\"https://jitsi.org/meet\" target=\"_blank\">https://jitsi.org/meet</a>)\nTogether with FLOSS server software like Kamailio, Asterisk and FreeSWITCH, Jitsi represents an open alternative to proprietary communications systems such as Skype, or Live Messenger. Our communities often work together on various problems.\nThe development of Jitsi started at the University of Strasbourg, France (<a href=\"http://www.unistra.fr\" target=\"_blank\">http://www.unistra.fr</a>) but has grown to include contributors from all over the world. Many of them have actually joined after successfully participating in previous GSoC editions. Jitsi is based on the OSGi (<a href=\"http://osgi.org\" target=\"_blank\">http://osgi.org</a>) architecture using the Felix implementation from Apache, which makes it very extensible and developer friendly.</p>\n",

CMS, that can perform the updates without going to the administrative panel which:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Provides basic commands needed to perform site wide administration</li>\n<li>Architecturally fits in into future releases(e.g Joomla! 4.x, 5.x, etc) of Joomla! as well as backward compatibility for \n  previous releases.</li>\n<li>Is extendable with a good plugin mechanism that allows future ideas to be integrated e.g Allowing commands to be \n added.     </li>\n<li>Allows not just updates to be done but also allows changing of some settings.</li>\n<li>Ensures Proper Error and Exception Handling.</li>\n</ul>\n",

So it plays an important role for the overall user experience of Plasma.

For that, it is necessary to port the KCMs to Qt Quick, which is quite tedious work and requires a lot of manpower. My primary goal is to help the KDE Community in this immense task, by porting the keyboard input modules, with modern designs provided by the KDE Visual Design Group (VDG).</p>\n<p>Another additional goal is to integrate the input method configurations, such as ibus or fcitx, into the System Settings application. Currently, the only way to install / configure these input methods is to install it from a package manager and use the GUI provided by the input method, which is far from discoverable. The ability to add / remove and configure IMEs will improve user experience for a global audience.</p>\n",

This image mask creation hast to be performed super fast as it is done thousands of times each second. If the process of applying the images on canvas is not fast enough the painting process gets compromised and the enjoyment of painting is reduced.</p>\n<p>Optimizing the mask creation can be done using the AVX instructions sets to apply transformation in vectors of data in one step. In this case the data is the image component coordinates composing the mask. Programming AVX can be done using Vc optimization library, which manages low level optimization adaptable to the user processor features. However the data must be prepared so it optimizes effectively. Optimization has already been done on the Default brush mask engine allowing it to be as much as 5 times faster than the current Gaussian mask engine.</p>\n<p>The project aims to improve painting performance by implementing AVX optimization code for Circular Gauss, Circular Soft, Rectangular Gaussian, Rectangular Soft Rectangular and Stamp mask.</p>\n",

By allowing kernel scripting, a user may create scripts in Lua to customize their kernel to suit their needs. Modern day kernels, such as Linux, work on a highly concurrent environment, and therefore must use robust synchronization APIs to ensure data consistency, with each API having their own use cases.</p>\n<p>The Read-copy-update (RCU) is one of those APIs, made specifically for scenarios where data reading is much more common than writing. RCU allows concurrent readers to access protected data in a non-blocking way even during updates or removals.

Our focus is on adapting encryption technology to make it easy to use and widely available. We want to make it possible for any service provider to easily deploy secure services, and for people to use these services without needing to learn new software or change their behavior. These services are based on open, federated standards, but done right: the provider does not have access to the user’s data, and we use open protocols in the most secure way possible.</p>\n<p>On the server side we have created the LEAP Platform, a “provider in a box” set of complementary packages and server recipes automated to lower the barriers of entry for aspiring secure service providers. On the client side, we have created a cross-platform application called Bitmask that automatically configures itself once a user has selected a provider and which services to enable. Bitmask provides a local proxy that a standard email client can connect to, and allows for easy one-click Virtual Private Network (VPN) service.</p>\n<p>The LEAP email system has several security advantages over typical encryption applications: if not already encrypted, incoming email is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it; email is always stored client-encrypted, both locally and when synchronized with the server; all message relay among service providers is required to be encrypted when possible; and public keys are automatically discovered and validated. In short, the Bitmask app offers full end-to-end encryption, quietly handling the complexities of public key encryption and allowing for backward compatibility with legacy email when necessary. Because the LEAP system is based on open, federated protocols, the user is able to change providers at will, preventing provider dependency and lock-in.</p>\n",

LibreOffice is compatible with many file formats like Microsoft® Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Publisher. At its heart though, LibreOffice is built around an open standard, the OpenDocument Format, as its native file format.</p>\n<p>LibreOffice is developed by users who, just like you, believe in the principles of Free Software and in sharing their work with the world in non-restrictive ways. The development of LibreOffice is supported by The Document Foundation which provides the infrastructure for the project.</p>\n<p>We believe that users should have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software that we distribute. While we do offer no-cost downloads of the LibreOffice suite of programs, Free Software is first and foremost a matter of liberty, not price. We campaign for these freedoms because we believe that everyone deserves them.</p>\n<p>Though the members of our community hail from many different backgrounds, we all value personal choice and transparency, which translates practically into wider compatibility, more utility, and no end-user lock-in to a single product. We believe that Free Software can provide better-quality, higher-reliability, increased-security, and greater-flexibility than proprietary alternatives. LibreOffice is a large project (approx. 6MLOC), which makes it interestingly complex, but at the same time, provides a place for all sorts of contribution &amp; skills.</p>\n<p>The community behind LibreOffice is the heart of the project, without which we would not have the resources to continue developing our software. The passion and drive that every individual brings to the community results in collaborative development that often exceeds our own expectations. With tons of different roles in the project, we invite everyone to join us in our work and help us to make LibreOffice known, prosper, and accessible to all.</p>\n",

Maybe we dont need to use cache to fix this maybe some other mechanism can be implemented to prevent this from happening which is why I need a mentor :).

The secret to its success is its <em>embeddability</em>: Lua is a tiny portable core than can be adapted to any project.</p>\n<p>The flip-side to this is that Lua itself does not come with many libraries, it features only the bare minimum. Enter LuaRocks: by using it to  install additional packages called \"rocks\", LuaRocks turbo-charges Lua, making it a suitable language for any field.</p>\n<h3>The package repository</h3>\n<p>In the <a href=\"http://luarocks.org\" target=\"_blank\">luarocks.org</a> repository one can find packages for all sorts of areas. LuaRocks also allows third-party projects to host their own package repositories (either in <a href=\"http://luarocks.org\" target=\"_blank\">luarocks.org</a> or in their own servers), so that LuaRocks can work as the plugin manager to their project.</p>\n<h3>The build system</h3>\n<p>LuaRocks also doubles as a portable build system for compiling Lua modules. It abstracts away platform differences and allows module developers using Lua or C to distribute Lua extensions that can build in any modern operating system.</p>\n",

On desktop, this situation prevents writing clients, bots and bridges that can interact with encrypted rooms in any other language than javascript. Tackling this issue would benefit the matrix ecosystem by seeing more featureful projects emerge in a variety of languages (Python in this case). It also supports the Matrix long-term goal of having E2E encryption turned on by default in private rooms.</p>\n",

MusicBrainz has MBIDs (MusicBrainz-ID) associated with each artist, recording, and release. In order to provide MusicBrainz with the ability to access information based on MBIDs, we have to associate recording_mbids, artist_mbids and release_mbids to the listens where we can.

Basically when facing situations similar to what we have encountered before. This phenomenon signalled the development of many mathematical models of similarity.</p>\n<p>Metric learning is one amongst those models that perform the task of devising similarities over objects. It has a plethora of applications in fields like information retrieval and recommendation system. Also, many machine learning approaches rely on some metric. This includes unsupervised techniques such as clustering, supervised procedures like KNN classification and semi-supervised modes as well. Metric learning has been involved as a preprocessing step for many of these approaches.</p>\n<p>Henceforth learning a neat distance metric is a crucial task for forming similarities. LMNN &amp; BoostMetric are among the supervised distance metric learning techniques which excel in this task. Accordingly, the fundamental objective of this project is to code novel implementations of LMNN &amp; BoostMetric, with the purpose of achieving better benchmarking over kNN classification.</p>\n",

Most collaborative filtering algorithms, including the ones existing in mlpack, use matrix factorization for this. Although MF is de facto, it cannot deal with complex user-item relationships and also need the user to provide ratings explicitly (explicit feedback). This project proposal deals with these drawbacks by implementing a module for neural collaborative filtering, which can represent complex user-item interaction using neural networks and also can handle implicit feedback (comprising any interaction user has with any item as a positive instance). Neural collaborative filtering, if needed, can also be generalized to matrix factorization. NCF has been proved to give better hit ratio and other metrics than neighborhood based algorithms, and also gives comparable RMSE with existing CF methods in mlpack. This module can give much more flexible recommendations, even when there is less explicit feedback available.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<h3>Why Terasology</h3>\n<p>We set out to see how an open source and super extensible voxel game inspired by Minecraft could go beyond it and offer gameplay like seen in Dwarf Fortress or Dungeon Keeper. What would modders come up with if you could create and ship a mod with a few simple commands, making it available immediately for download in-game by others, in a secure sandboxed environment?</p>\n<h3>Minimal Engine</h3>\n<p>Our engine is intended to be as bare-bone as possible, even excluding such basics as inventory, health, creatures, or combat. A series of minimal modules are meant to be bundled with the game's standard distribution to offer a sort of vanilla game experience, with a focus on commonly used systems that are often fragmented and re-implemented many times over. All such modules are community owned and maintained, guaranteed to work with every release.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>Any content is wrapped in modules ranging from tiny frameworks supporting commonly needed utility to large gameplay templates commonly referred to as mod packs in the Minecraft world, that in turn can depend on dozens of the smaller pieces, maximizing reusability.</p>\n<p>Creating a new module is as easy as running a single gradlew command, having a community repository created on GitHub is another single request away, and fetching source for any such community module is yet another single command. Dependency resolution is supported within the engine framework both for development and for runtime usage, including auto-downloading from a running game server to connecting clients.</p>\n",

Content is provided through modules which build on, tweak and integrate with both the engine and each other. This creates a wealth of content for the player to choose from.<br>\nOr at least that is the intention. Currently the major content for Terasology is extremely similar to content seen in other games like Minecraft, MineTest and similar sandbox games. However due to how modular the design is, it has the potential to have a breadth of content that eclipses either of those two. Which is where this project comes in.</p>\n<p><strong>GooeyDefence</strong><br>\nTower Defence is a very well known game genre, and one that is also consistently popular. This project aims to add a tower defence game mode to Terasology, with a sandbox spin on it. The game mode allows for modular tower building and freeform block placement. It is intended to show off the best of Terasology and thus is designed to be extremely extensible as well as to use content from other modules.<br>\n<a href=\"https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DN4LxL8nSd9ZUbqhpXIfasmm8PQykJonOw7nUpKXpoo/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\">The original proposal can be seen here</a></p>\n<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>\n",

A significant challenge in the systems biology field is the reproducibility and reusability of such models and making these accessible to the broader biology community. To address this issue, computer-readable formats and tools for modeling complex biological systems have been developed. Standards such as Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) and tools like Systems Biology Simulation Core Library (SBSCL) can represent such complex biological models and numerically simulate them. But until now only a subset of these standards have been implemented in SBSCL. Essential features that will catalyze reproducibility, exchangeability, and reusability are lacking so far. Namely, i) implementation of full support for simulation experiments; ii) plots and visualization of simulation studies; iii) support for standard archive formats; iv) support for Open Source solvers, and v) support for hierarchical models.</p>\n",

To make the visualization of biocircuits more efficient and amenable to automation, my goal is to upgrade DNAplotlib to support highly customizable visualizations of genetic circuits from SBOL version 2 files. \nI will achieve this by integrating DNAplotlib with the pySBOL2 library to support reading and writing of SBOL2 files. The current DNAplotlib only support SBOL 1.0 documentation, and thus is only capable of manifesting DNA components consisted of DNA sequence and sequence annotation. It cannot represent complex interactions between different subcomponents, and thus has poor connectivity with other genetic platforms. Through my work this summer, DNAplotlib will (1) incorporate non-DNA components / partially complete design sequences (2) document and link to external models such as SBML and CellML (3) visualize hierarchical and modular biosystems (4) save customization into SBOL file.</p>\n",

Those models that come from speech recognition seem to be particularly susceptible to this phenomenon. The present project proposes to create a working implementation of a speech recognition model using the Flux library for the Julia programming language and contribute its code to the Flux model zoo. The model to be implemented is Zhang et al.'s (2017) model from their paper \"Towards end-to-end speech recognition with deep convolutional neural networks.\" Due to being implemented using only convolutional layers, this model will be lighter to train than previous models that have used heavier recurrent layers, while still achieving state-of-the-art performance. Having a working implementation of this network will be a step forward in opening the culture of automatic speech recognition. As a result, newcomers to the field will have a recent example to look at for inspiration, which is paramount because there are not many novice-friendly resources available for doing speech recognition research.</p>\n",

However, a wide range of modern N-body hydrodynamics simulations now use smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) which produces data consisting of volume filling fields. The current implementation of yt takes this data fills a global octtree, and then treats it similarly to that of AMR data.</p>\n<p>The disadvantage of this treatment of SPH data is that it is not intuitive to users, it is slow and it does not represent the underlying nature of the data.</p>\n<p>This project aims to develop a yt API for SPH data that ensures all SPH fields return data defined at the locations of the particles. Whilst this would provide a more intuitive way to interact with the data, it is still important to interpolate particle data onto grids, as this is essential in visualisation. This can be achieved by taking inspiration from SPLASH. Thus, at the end of the project SPH fields would be able to be visualised using a \"scatter\" (in technical details) approach, inspired by SPLASH. This would allow the the SPH fields to be interpolated efficiently onto grids.</p>\n",

Not all package maintainers remember to update the feedstock when releasing new versions, however, causing some packages on conda-forge to be out of date. Recently, the conda-forge autotick bot was developed to automatically track out of date feedstocks and open pull requests to bump them to the newest version of the source code.

This would not only help in analyzing the key areas that need immediate attention for coverage but will also help in maintaining higher code coverage for future developments.</p>\n<p>yt's test suite could be divided into three areas, namely, Python unit tests, Cython test cases and answer testing. I will enhance the yt test suite by writing test cases for the flows that are not being tested currently. Runtime of tests could be improved by optimizing (or reducing) answer testing and image comparisons tests for visualization and volume rendering modules. This project also focuses on streamlining test cases for different geometries and data styles to improve the runtime of tests. Furthermore, the runtime of test suites varies on Linux and OSX, thereby giving us a scope of improvement.</p>\n",

Once there is reasonable level of confidence in the correctness of the model, the task that remains is to estimate the parameters of the model. Due to the structure of parameter estimation problems in dynamical models, statistics and machine learning techniques are an ideal choice for determining the parameters. During the course of the summer I will be implementing some statistical algorithms, including Stochastic Approximation Expectation Maximization(SAEM) and Maximum A Posteriori Estimation (MAP), for parameter estimation of a dynamic model. I will also work on extending support for parameter estimation in Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) by adding first differences distribution to generalized Log-Likelihood. These would be quite important additions to the suite of methods in JuliaDiffEq and would be of great use to scientific community involved in systems biology, HIV-AIDS study, and drug dosage estimation.</p>\n",

FBA or, Flux Balance Analysis is the earliest COBRA method and the most widely used. But, currently, we have sub-divisions of metabolic modelling strategies which are uncovering the flaws of FBA. To fix these flaws, we have been developing multiple methods which are also being backed by experimental data. So, now we are integrating data from experiments in the models and developing methods for a much better understanding of the metabolic pathways and functionalities of the organisms. The data-driven approaches provide more information about the models and hence provide us with a deeper understanding of the networks.</p>\n",

The RDKit already supports a broad variety of fingerprinting functionality but is limited by the fact that the current fingerprint implementations are all independent and have slightly different APIs. This makes things unnecessarily complicated for users and requires people who are interested in exploring new types of fingerprints to write far more code than it seems like they should have to. In this project we will create a generic decoupled fingerprinting module with a consistent and flexible API.</p>\n",

The project provides a gender sensitive course concept and materials for teachers to run coding classes. The idea behind the Open Roberta Lab is to provide a simple and easy to use programming environment for everybody.</p>\n<h5>The lab</h5>\n<p>The Open Roberta® Lab is an open source programming environment, developed to introduce kids to programming robots and microcontrollers. The software is a web application running in the browser. Users program robots using a Blockly-based graphical programming language called NEPO®. A simulation is available for those who don't have a real robot at hand. Since 2014 <a href=\"https://lab.open-roberta.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://lab.open-roberta.org/</a> is online and has had more than 100.000+ visits in 2017 across 135 countries.</p>\n<p>The backend is written in Java. It provides user management and robot support in the form of an evolving plugin system. Each robot subsystem handles code generation and communication with the robot. As of now the project comes with 7 different robot plugins:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>EV3 LEGO Mindstorms </li>\n<li>NXT LEGO Mindstorms</li>\n<li>BBC micro:bit </li>\n<li>Calliope mini</li>\n<li>Bot’n Roll, Arduino-based</li>\n<li>NAO, a humanoide robot</li>\n<li>Bob3</li>\n</ul>\n<h5>Outlook</h5>\n<p>While the software is stable and widely used, we're looking for new ideas, but also help on existing ideas to develop the project further.</p>\n",

There are many good alternative motion planning libraries that could be re-added to MoveIt, including: SBPL, STOMP, ITOMP, DRAKE. This project focuses on the addition of support for motion planning libraries in MoveIt planners. MoveIt only had a single stable motion planning library as its core motion planner, i.e. OMPL. As a part of this GSoC project, motion planning support was extended by making other motion planners (CHOMP) more stable and porting STOMP also to be a part of the MoveIt motion planners family. The MoveIt part of STOMP was ported from the ros-industrial/industrial_moveit repository into moveit/motion-planners. Furthermore, benchmarking package was made to work with other motion planners in addition to OMPL and tutorials for the same were added. Planning Request Adapters were extended to include motion planners like CHOMP, STOMP to be used as an additional step with OMPL or other motion planners to produce better trajectories in different situations. Tutorials for Planning request adapters will also be added in moveit_tutorials repository.</p>\n",

A few examples in the literature use different approaches to the problem, and calculate the different spectrum of the light emitted at different phases of these oscillations.

Prevention and treatment of HIV/AIDS on this scale requires efficient information management, which is critical as HIV/AIDS care must increasingly be entrusted to less skilled providers. Whether for lack of time, developers, or money, most HIV/AIDS programs in developing countries manage their information with simple spreadsheets or small, poorly designed databases...if anything at all. To help them, we need to find a way not only to improve management tools, but also to reduce unnecessary, duplicative efforts. As a response to these challenges, OpenMRS formed in 2004 as a open source medical record system framework for developing countries -- a tide which rises all ships. Over the past decade, OpenMRS has been adapted and used beyond HIV/AIDS for TB, Ebola, maternal-child health, and chronic care. OpenMRS is a multi-institution, nonprofit collaborative led by organizations such as Regenstrief Institute, Inc. (regenstrief.org), a world-renowned leader in medical informatics research, and Partners In Health (pih.org), a Boston-based philanthropic organization with a focus on improving the lives of underprivileged people worldwide through health care service and advocacy. We have also formed a non-profit, OpenMRS, Inc., whose mission is to support the worldwide OpenMRS community. These teams nurture a growing worldwide network of individuals and organizations all focused on creating medical record systems and a corresponding implementation network to allow system development self reliance within resource constrained environments. To date, OpenMRS has been implemented in dozens of developing countries, including South Africa, Kenya, Rwanda, Lesotho, Uganda, Tanzania, Haiti, Mozambique, Sierra Leone, and India.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>In the summer of 2008 the <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/\" target=\"_blank\">Metropolitan City of Rome</a> decided to start a <strong>free of charge and public Wi-Fi network</strong> to be spread over its 5352 SQ KM territory including Rome and 120 other cities for a total of about 4.5 million inhabitants. The main objective of the project, called <strong>ProvinciaWiFi</strong> (later renamed <a href=\"http://www.cittametropolitanaroma.gov.it/index.php/wifimetropolitano-english-version\" target=\"_blank\">WiFi Metropolitano</a>), was to take a decisive step to reduce the existing <strong>digital divide</strong> by fostering and facilitating the use of ICT by citizens.</p>\n<p>From the outset it was decided to commit the project to a completely open philosophy. For this reason a clear choice towards open software and operating systems and the availability of every modification, update and improvement to the community was made. The same approach was adopted for the knowledge and the experience acquired within the project. In order to pursue this goals the Province of Rome called the university consortium <em>CASPUR</em> (later merged in the <a href=\"https://www.cineca.it/en\" target=\"_blank\">CINECA</a> consortium) to develop the technical solution. In this context, a research project conducted by the <em>CINECA</em> consortium found its perfect application. This project proposed an innovative methodology for the distribution of networks (more precisely Virtual LANs used for Wi-Fi connectivity) between geographically distant sites.</p>\n<p>The methodology adopted made it possible to host public connectivity services on non-dedicated network infrastructures (e.g.: private xDSL) that for technical and legal reasons could not be used as such.  This is not the sole advantage that OpenWISP gave to <em>WiFi Metropolitano</em>: embracing the resource-sharing philosophy – typical of open projects – anyone can contribute to the network expansion simply by hosting an access point.\n The software tools and the architectures, including the OpenWISP 2 <a href=\"http://openwisp.org/whatis.html#wifi-controller\" target=\"_blank\">wifi controller</a> and different <a href=\"http://netjson.org/\" target=\"_blank\">NetJSON</a> implementations used in OpenWISP,  are released to the public free of charge under open-source licenses, we hope this will allow a broader audience to benefit from this work and improve upon it.</p>\n",

The Oppia platform allows collaborative creation of interactive learning experiences that simulate a friendly, non-judgmental tutor. For an example, see: <a href=\"https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.oppia.org/collection/4UgTQUc1tala</a></p>\n<h3>Interactive learning</h3>\n<p>Oppia teaches content in small units called <em>explorations</em>. <em>Learners</em> (users who visit Oppia to learn something) explore a new topic through an exploration. Explorations can have multiple paths the learner may take depending on their answers (similar to video games). Different answers result in Oppia responding differently.</p>\n<p>A user may repeatedly struggle on a certain question. Oppia can detect this and branch away from the current topic, so that learners may practice fundamentals before attempting that question again. Oppia aims to act like a tutor, an educational guide who can help learners practice topics and watch for any mistakes they might make. One of the most important roles of Oppia is to gently show learners where they went wrong and instruct them on a correct approach.</p>\n<h3>Community-driven lesson creation</h3>\n<p>The other half of Oppia is a community of <em>creators</em> (users who create explorations). Creating explorations is a bit like creating a video game, and we face some similar challenges. Our exploration editor needs to help creators identify spots in their explorations where users are struggling, or facilitate the creation of targeted responses and branches for certain types of learner answers (such as addressing common misconceptions among learners). Work in this area also includes facilitating the community side of Oppia by encouraging collaborative content creation among all topic areas.</p>\n<h3>Come join us!</h3>\n<p>Oppia is a very exciting project to work on and we're really excited for more people to join us!</p>\n",

Unlike\nLandsat images, Sentinel 2 datasets do not include thermal and Quality Assessment bands that simplify\nthe detection of clouds avoiding erroneous classification. At the same time, clouds shadows on the ground lead to anomalous reflectance values which have to be taken into account during the image processing.\nThe project aim is the coding of a specific module for GRASS GIS application which implements the procedure developed within my PhD research. The procedure allows to automatically identify clouds and their shadows in Sentinel 2 images applying some rules on reflectance values (values thresholds, comparisons between bands, etc.). These have been defined starting from rules found in literature and conveniently refined. Then the detection of shadows is improved using an adapted shape index. In order to increase the accuracy of the final results, a control check is implemented. Clouds and shadows are spatially intersected in order to remove misclassified areas. The final outputs are two different vector files (OGR standard formats), one for clouds and one for shadows.</p>\n",

Also currently there is no test coverage for plugin code which makes it difficult to change features efficiently, so a complete unit test coverage will be built which not only will help in this project but also in future ventures. In addition to this I propose to add functionality for the proposed stable functions of following families:</p>\n<p>Astar : pgr_astarCost , pgr_astarCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Bidirectional astar : pgr_bdAstarCost , pgr_bdAstarCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Bidirectional Dijkstra : pgr_bdDijkstraCost , pgr_bdDijkstraCostMatrix</p>\n<p>Flow</p>\n",

Practically this means that, a WebSocket opened from a page behind authentication  doesn’t “automatically” receive any sort of authentication. That makes possible to establish a connection without authentication making use of http and origin headers field of the client. Some other posible attacks and scans at WebSockets are the classic bruteforce attack, Local and Remote file inclusion, the Stored and Reflected Cross-Site Scripting. I am going to implement some of the above scans, (as more as possible) starting with SQls Injections. I strongly believe that we could easily add the scans if the basic infrastructure was build.

Many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data. Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) project specifically seeks to improve this ability. Ultimately, PEcAn aims to make ecosystem modelling and data assimilation routine tools for answering scientific questions and informing policy and management.</p>\n<h3>How does PEcAn do that?</h3>\n<p>PEcAn consists of <strong>1)</strong> state-of-the-art ecosystem models that themselves are scaffolds for integrating multiple data sources and theory, <strong>2)</strong> a workflow management system to handle the numerous streams of data, and <strong>3)</strong> a data assimilation statistical framework in order to synthesize the data with the model. PEcAn automates analyses aimed at understanding and forecasting ecosystem responses through these models.</p>\n<h3>Transparency, repeatability, accessibility</h3>\n<p>PEcAn's scientific workflow management fully captures the informatics of where the model inputs came from, how they were processed, how sets of model runs were completed, and how the model output was post-processed and visualized for maximizing transparency and repeatability. PEcAn's intuitive web-based interface allows non-modelers or novices to use models and techniques developed by experts.</p>\n<h3>High functionality and performance</h3>\n<p>In addition to making the PEcAn source code open source, the system is also available as a fully functional virtual machine that runs on a wide range of operating systems. The system can also interact with remote high-performance computing environments, allowing model runs to be done in parallel on remote clusters.</p>\n",

To simplify this process, the PEcAn team would benefit from an application that can download datasets from any data federation, and parse the metadata so that it can be automatically read into PEcAn. To help further them in this direction, I will create an ingest workflow for a single data federation, DataOne, as a proof of concept. This app will be able to resolve data by doi. I will also add drag and drop functionality to facilitate downloading data from unsupported data federations. This app will then facilitate the process of selecting the correct semantics necessary in order to ingest data into BETYdb (the PEcAn database) by walking the user through this complex process. This app will also serve future development by creating a probability distribution of the semantics selected by the users. This distribution can be used to train a machine learning algorithm that will suggest semantic selection with greater accuracy in the future.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>This project will explore extending a new feature for the Performance Co-Pilot (PCP). PCP is an open source framework at the system level that monitors, analyze and retrieve information to understand system performance. It has a distributed architecture of agents, called Performance Metric Domain Agents (PMDA), that extract performance values from the desired environments or systems.</p>\n<p>Every agent (PMDA) reports to a centralized daemon called Performance Metric Collection Daemon or PMCD per host. Then, accessing any metric is as easy as sending a request to PMCDs. PCP has several client tools to help the final user understand the metrics. Finally, PCP also offers a good API to create an agent for any software.</p>\n<p>Coming back to the interest of the proposal, PCP also supports instrumentation. This is a way to enable user applications like Firefox to send metrics in execution time to the PMDA. In this scenario, Memory Mapped Values (MMV) are used to offer an extremely lightweight mechanism for instrumenting applications using shared memory. However, there is no support for metadata labels added since the newest v4, and hence the goal of this project: add label support for instrumentation.</p>\n",

Since PCP metadata and data keys are distributed across potentially many Redis servers, Redis nodes need to communicate with one another for data access/transfer. Communication between Redis nodes (Redis clients with the Redis servers) is carried out by protocol called RESP (REdis Serialization Protocol). As Redis protocol (RESP) and the pmproxy'd PCP protocol can co-exist, the main goal of this project is extending pmproxy to support RESP such that an arbitrary Redis client can access the distributed key store using the direct key-to-server mapping mechanism used by the existing PCP time series code. Sub-goals include integrating libuv library with pmproxy. libuv is a multi-platform support library with a focus on asynchronous I/O.</p>\n",

For example, it can highlight unused variables, empty catch blocks or too complex code, just to name a few.</p>\n<h3>Programming Languages</h3>\n<p>Initially PMD started out to be a Java-only code analyzer. But nowadays, it fully supports 8 languages: Java, JavaScript, Salesforce.com Apex and Visualforce, PLSQL, Apache Velocity, XML and XSL. All languages provide many rules, that you can immediately use to check your source code.</p>\n<h3>Copy-Paste-Detector</h3>\n<p>Additionally it includes CPD, the copy-paste-detector. CPD finds duplicated code in all the above languages and additionally in C, C++, C#, Groovy, PHP, Ruby, Fortran, Scala, Objective C, Matlab, Python, Go, and Swift.</p>\n<h3>Usage</h3>\n<p>PMD has over 50000 monthly downloads and is actively used by many open source and closed source projects. It is integrated into most common build tools like Maven, Gradle and Ant, but it can also be used from the command line. Integrations into CI systems such as Jenkins can provide comparisons between builds to see quality improvements or degradation over time based on the issues found by PMD. When integrated into the build, PMD can serve as a quality gate.</p>\n<h3>Extensibility</h3>\n<p>PMD comes out of the box with many rules in the area of code design, optimizations, naming and many more. It provides a flexible infrastructure to customize the existing rules via properties and to define completely new custom rules. The rules can be organized in rulesets, which can be shared within a software project, so that every developer is using the same PMD configuration.</p>\n<p>An innovative approach allows to define PMD rules using a single XPath expression, allowing developers to do so without having to write code or deal with PMD internals. PMD ships with a designer tool to help build and test such expressions. More complex rules can be coded in Java using a visitor pattern over the analyzed code.</p>\n",

It has more than 15 years of active development and a proven architecture that has earned it a strong reputation for reliability, data integrity, and correctness. It runs on all major operating systems, including Linux, UNIX (AIX, BSD, HP-UX, macOS, Solaris), and Windows. It is fully ACID compliant, has full support for foreign keys, joins, views, triggers, and stored procedures (in multiple languages). It includes most SQL:2008 data types, including INTEGER, NUMERIC, BOOLEAN, CHAR, VARCHAR, DATE, INTERVAL, and TIMESTAMP. It also supports storage of binary large objects, including pictures, sounds, or video. It has native programming interfaces for C/C++, Java, .Net, Perl, Python, Ruby, Tcl, ODBC, among others, and exceptional documentation.</p>\n<p>An enterprise class database, PostgreSQL boasts sophisticated features such as Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), point in time recovery, tablespaces, asynchronous replication, nested transactions (savepoints), online/hot backups, a sophisticated query planner/optimizer, and write ahead logging for fault tolerance. It supports international character sets, multibyte character encodings, Unicode, and it is locale-aware for sorting, case-sensitivity, and formatting. It is highly scalable both in the sheer quantity of data it can manage and in the number of concurrent users it can accommodate. There are active PostgreSQL instances in production environments that manage many terabytes of data, as well as clusters managing petabytes. Some general PostgreSQL limits are included in the table below.</p>\n",

The traditional approach in RDBMS world involves doing an expensive ALTER TABLE operation, slow upgrade of an existing data, and stuff like this. This approach is often slow and inconvenient for application developers.\nTo solve this issue PostgreSQL provides JSON and JSONB datatypes. Unfortunately JSONB has a disadvantage of storing all documents keys, which is a lot of redundant data.\nOne possibility to to reduce JSONB redundancy is to use zson extension. It compresses JSONB documents using shared dictionary of common strings that appear in all or most documents. This approach has its limitations though. Particularly, since data schema evolves, the dictionary has to be updated from time to time. Also zson can affect the build-in mechanism of PostgreSQL of compressing data using PGLZ algorithm since this mechanism uses some heuristics to recognize data that compresses well. Thus sometimes zson can reduce the overall performance.\nThe idea of this project is to create an extension that provides Thrift support which solves zson problem.</p>\n",

The status gets updated each time the pull request title is changed.</p>\n<h3>How does Probot work?</h3>\n<p>Probot is a Node.js framework based on the <a href=\"http://expressjs.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Express Server framework</a>. It provides APIs to subscribe to events that are happening on GitHub to run your custom code. For example, the <code>WIP GitHub App</code> mentioned above is built with Probot in only about 20 lines of code: <a href=\"https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master\" target=\"_blank\">https://github.com/gr2m/wip-bot/tree/master</a></p>\n<h3>Why apply for Probot?</h3>\n<p>You will create your very own GitHub application, your own product that you can add to your portfolio at the end of the summer. While working on your own app, you will interact with the Probot core team and learn how to contribute to the core project itself.</p>\n<p>We look forward to meeting you :)</p>\n",

So currently, mails are sended synchronously. And if the sending of mail is failed due to some reason or we don't want to send the mail at the time of request/response or if we want that a mail should be sent after (1 day or any specific period of time) we can't implement it now.\nSometimes, we have to run jobs at particular intervals to, say, backup logs, send emails, etc. In rails application we can schedule such tasks using the whenever gem.\nFor integrating cron jobs with the plots2 we can implement whenever gem which will be very useful in sending daily \"batch digest\" email to the subscribers. We can specify the time when the email should be sent. More details on implementation is in Implementation part.\nAnother feature is the reply-by-email feature using mailman gem.\nFeature that we can implement is of reply by tweet which is very convenient and easy for the user to do.</p>\n",

There are several modules for performing many common tasks related to MRI image analysis (such as de-noising, image registration and clustering) [1]. These modules have been under active open development as a community initiative and have been well-tested. In this proposal, I will focus on extending the core functionality by building workflows that can achieve various tasks (varying from simple image registration to image de-noising, clustering etc. in an automated manner). These workflows will be powerful abstractions for the domain users (specifically medical practitioners) to achieve several tasks related to diffusion MRI image analysis with minimal manual intervention.</p>\n",

          "abstract_html": "<p>DIPY is an open source software mainly focusing on diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) analysis. For nonrigid image registration, it implements a Symmetric Normalization framework. The major goal of this framework is to calculate an affine or deffeomorphic transformation to register two 2D images or 3D volumes. As a well-known problem, registration is a non-convex optimization problem. It is very important to initialize as close to the solution as possible. So in order to avoid getting stuck at local optima, it uses a multi-resolution strategy by building a Gaussian Pyramid. That is to say we can register our images in as many stages as we want, providing previous results as initialization for the next. As this way, we need to do a lot of iterations, thus it slow down the optimization process.\n    To speed up the calculation, one solution is to convert to a parallel computing algorithm. The OpenMP API supports multi-platform shared-memory parallel programming in C/C++ and Fortran. So in this project, I will implement a multi-thread algorithm using OpenMP to improve the performance of nonrigid image registration in DIPY.</p>\n",

We leverage this technology alongside a proven curriculum of learning techniques from top educational researchers.</p>\n<p>Learners begin by completing a <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/diagnostic\" target=\"_blank\">diagnostic activity</a> that provides the learning management system enough information to predict where the student is strong and where they need improvement. Then, teachers can assign follow up activities that provide practice targeted specifically to where the student is falling short. (There are even <a href=\"https://medium.com/writing-with-quill/quill-org-launches-ell-diagnostic-ac2dd65de692\" target=\"_blank\">special versions of the diagnostic</a> for English language learners whose first languages are Spanish, Mandarin, French, Vietnamese, Arabic, and Hindi.)</p>\n<p>Quill has a variety of activity types, including <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/lessons\" target=\"_blank\">a real-time classroom lessons mode</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/connect\" target=\"_blank\">a sentence construction tool</a>, <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/proofreader\" target=\"_blank\">a proofreading practice tool</a> and <a href=\"https://www.quill.org/tools/grammar\" target=\"_blank\">a grammar practice tool</a>.</p>\n<p>Each tool has associated algorithms for assessing and providing targeted feedback in response to student submissions. These algorithms utilize rules-based logic, natural language processing, and machine learning.</p>\n<h3>What's Next?</h3>\n<p>Up until now, Quill has primarily been built as a tool for educators to use with their students. This means that Quill does not currently have a self-study mode for learners who are not in a classroom setting. We're excited for the GSoC community to help leverage Quill's progress so far into a learning tool that can assist millions of learners around the world who deserve better education.</p>\n",

The major advantage is that the marginal distribution can be modelled separate from the trawl function, allowing for a very flexible modelling of the autocorrelation structure exhibiting short or long memory. This class of processes has recently been applied in high frequency econometrics where it is used to describe the behaviour of financial spreads and price processes at ultra high frequencies.</p>\n<p>Currently, there is no open source code available to replicate any of the recent academic research. Similarly, practitioners wishing to apply these methods have no dependable source code to rely on.

The current R packages have limitations of using simple methods like linear models or propensity score matching to estimate average treatment effects in the population or at subgroup levels, which ignores the heterogeneity in the large observed data. Besides, these packages only focus on point-in-time estimates.

Red Hen develops code in Natural Language Processing, audio parsing, computer vision, and joint multimodal analysis.</p>\n<p>Red Hen's multimodal communication research involves locating, identifying, and characterizing auditory and visual elements in videos and pictures. We may provide annotated clips or images and present the challenge of developing the machine learning tools to find additional instances in a much larger dataset. Some examples are gestures, eye movements, and tone of voice. We favor projects that combine more than one modality, but have a clear communicative function -- an example would be floor-holding techniques. Once a feature has been successfully identified in our full dataset of several hundred thousand hours of news videos, cognitive linguists, communication scholars, and political scientists can use this information to study higher-level phenomena in language, culture, and politics and develop a better understanding of the full spectrum of human communication. Our dataset is recorded in a large number of languages, giving Red Hen a global perspective.</p>\n<p>For GSoC 2018, we invite proposals from students for components for a unified multimodal processing pipeline, whose aim is to extract information from text, audio, and video, and to develop integrative cross-modal feature detection tasks. Red Hen Lab is directed jointly by Francis Steen (UCLA) and Mark Turner (Case Western Reserve University).</p>\n",

As per today, no work has been done now which includes multimodality into account (especially audio ) to determine the kind of activities and scenes that person is involved when it comes to egocentric perception. I have already built an audio-based model based on popular IEEE-DCASE-challenge which can successfully classify scenes into categories like ( person is walking in a park, driving in a car ) for egocentric views. I plan to extend my work as part of gsoc-2k18 to incorporate my model with video-based models and increase the scope of model from scenes to scenes+activities. The final breakdown of the steps is submitted in the pre-proposal attached above. The idea is to built pyscene-detect for egocentric videos,  which would be a prominent contribution owing to growing research in the area of first person view  videos.</p>\n",

It is a well-known open source project on Github, therefore we can make our own breakthroughs based on the existing framework in this project.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Since these two architecture are both based on Tensorflow, we can actually refer both of the architectures when designing our own network.

For each segment, we will detect, crop, and align faces. This gives us a sequence of face images. A CNN will extract relevant features for each image in the sequence. These features will be sequentially fed to a RNN which will encode motion and facial expressions to predict emotion. The complete process will be implemented as a Python API with video input and JSON annotation output. Tensorflow, dlib, MTCNN and ffmpeg are used for various tasks in the project.</p>\n",

Rocket.Chat is a breath of fresh air empowering groups around the world to experience a self-hosted, private, distributed and unrestricted communications platform.</p>\n<p>Our server is written in NodeJS (server side JavaScript) and utilizes websocket connections to enable real-time interactive rich communications between a variety of clients – including web, mobile (both iOS and Android), and desktop (Windows, macOS, and Linux).  Mobile clients are crafted in Swift, Java and Kotlin, we also have a React Native client.</p>\n<p>The server is designed to be scalable from a family server on a Raspberry Pi 3, all the way to a cluster of servers for 10s of thousands of communicating users.  Its architecture leverages a \"modified Kafka’ish optimized MongoDB oplog tailing  (single source of truth append-only log) mechanism\" to scale across servers in a tunable yet performant manner.</p>\n<p>Rocket.Chat has been designed to be totally extensible. REST and realtime (websocket) APIs are available to control and customize various aspects of the server.  Extensions can be added modularly using standard node module mechanism.</p>\n<p>Chat bots are a popular means of extending the capabilities of Rocket.Chat. Adapters for popular bot framework, such as Hubot, are available and Rocket.Chat’s community published its own integration bots for code platforms including GitHub and Gitlab.  Rocket.Chat supports the chat bot and ML, conversational bots, and voicebot communities  - with adapters for new bot framework – including the bBot super-bot-framework.</p>\n",

Experienced Rails developers also report that it makes web application development more fun.</p>\n<p>Rails is opinionated software. It makes the assumption that there is a \"best\" way to do things, and it's designed to encourage that way - and in some cases to discourage alternatives. If you learn \"The Rails Way\" you'll probably discover a tremendous increase in productivity. If you persist in bringing old habits from other languages to your Rails development, and trying to use patterns you learned elsewhere, you may have a less happy experience.</p>\n<p>The Rails philosophy includes two major guiding principles:</p>\n<p>Don't Repeat Yourself: DRY is a principle of software development which states that \"Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.\" By not writing the same information over and over again, our code is more maintainable, more extensible, and less buggy.</p>\n<p>Convention Over Configuration: Rails has opinions about the best way to do many things in a web application, and defaults to this set of conventions, rather than require that you specify every minutiae through endless configuration files.</p>\n",

A rational point of an algebraic variety is a solution of set of equations in the given field (rational field if not mentioned). Much of the number theory can be viewed as the study of rational point of algebraic varieties. Some of the great achievements of number theory amount to determining the rational points on particular curves.\nFor example, Fermat’s last theorem is equivalent to the statement that for an integer n ≥ 3, the only rational point of the curve xn+yn=zn in P2 over Qare the obvious ones.  Common variants of these question include determining the set of all points of V(K) of height up to some bound.

At the root, the language’s scalability is the result of a careful integration of object-oriented and functional language concepts.\nScala is the preferred workhorse language for many mission-critical server systems. The generated code is on a par with Java’s and its precise typing means that many problems are caught at compile-time rather than after deployment.</p>\n<h3>Object-Oriented</h3>\n<p>Scala is a pure-bred object-oriented language. Conceptually, every value is an object and every operation is a method call. The language supports advanced component architectures through classes and traits.</p>\n<h3>Functional</h3>\n<p>Even though its syntax is fairly conventional, Scala is also a full-blown functional language. It has everything you would expect, including first-class functions, a library with efficient immutable data structures, and a general preference of immutability over mutation.</p>\n<h3>Seamless Java Interop</h3>\n<p>Scala runs on the JVM. Java and Scala classes can be freely mixed, no matter whether they reside in different projects or in the same. They can even mutually refer to each other, the Scala compiler contains a subset of a Java compiler to make sense of such recursive dependencies.</p>\n<h3>Fun</h3>\n<p>Maybe most important is that programming in Scala tends to be very enjoyable. No boilerplate, rapid iteration, but at the same time the safety of a strong static type system. As Graham Tackley from the Guardian says: “We’ve found that Scala has enabled us to deliver things faster with less code. It’s reinvigorated the team.”</p>\n",

The purpose is only to replace the game executable, not to enhance or replace the game assets.</p>\n<p>ScummVM is a collection of game engines for playing classic graphical point-and-click adventure games on modern hardware. Recently we have also started adding engines for RPG games.</p>\n<p>ResidualVM is a sister project of ScummVM games and was created in 2003. ResidualVM shares large blocks of common code with ScummVM, some developers and even a mentor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>ScummVM supports classic 2D adventure games such as Monkey Island, Simon the Sorcerer, Space Quest, and many more. We have also started work to support 2D RPG games such as Dungeon Master. To this end, the Virtual Machines (called Engines) are complete reimplementations in C++ of the engines used in the original games. The number of engines is constantly growing thanks to a very agile and diversified development team and ScummVM is currently able to run more than 200 games. The VM approach followed by ScummVM results in efficient code, which has been ported to numerous Operating Systems (over 30). ScummVM has a highly productive team of about 45 currently active developers (out of an all-time pool of over 130), working together on a codebase of 2,800,000 lines of code. In addition ScummVM has many non-developer contributors, and a huge and highly active community.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>ResidualVM is a cross-platform 3D game interpreter which allows you to play some 3D adventure games, such as Cyan's Myst 3 and LucasArts' Lua-based 3D adventures: Grim Fandango and Escape from Monkey Island, provided you already have their data files. Like ScummVM, ResidualVM replaces the executables shipped with the games, allowing you to play them on systems for which they were never designed.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n",

The traditional loss-based TCP algorithms like TCP CUBIC, reduce their sending rates greatly when detecting packet loss, and increase rates conservatively when no packets loss happens. However, it is hard to estimate the network condition just on basis of one metric, i.e, packet loss. As a consequence, loss-based TCP algorithms underutilize network during most of the time, but cause severe congestion occasionally.</p>\n<p>TCP BBR is a new variation of TCP algorithm which adjusts its sending rate based on the real-time network metric, i.e, packet round trip time (RTT), the delivered rate (goodput). It is optimal that the amount of traffic walking through a network link is just equal to the well-known bandwidth delay production (BDP). Hence, TCP BBR uses RTT and goodput to constrict the amount of traffic in flight is equal to BDP. In this way, TCP BBR can maximize the goodput, and minimize the RTT at the same time.</p>\n<p>As a high-performance network stack, it is very important for Seastar to provide such high-performance TCP algorithm to further upgrade the performance.</p>\n",

In the past, this data has been classified using a formula based on elevation angle, which is not always reliably available, or using another formula based on doppler velocity and spectral width which is biased to miscategorize low-velocity ionospheric backscatter (IS) as ground scatter (GS). Recently, researchers successfully applied machine learning techniques to this data. These approaches improved on past methods, but they used a very limited set of features and relied on simple machine learning methods that do not easily capture non-linear relationships or subtle probability distributions. This project applies machine learning methods with a focus on using a larger number of well-selected features and using more nuanced algorithms. The resulting Github toolkit provides combinations of DBSCAN and GMM for classifying SuperDARN data, along with various plotting tools. This project will continue after the summer, and I plan to add details on validation and try new algorithms.</p>\n",

This app will be a smaller version of Sugarizer. The app will be targeted towards Pre-k1 and Pre-k2 grade curriculum. The app will be focusing on kids who are non-readers and who are in the phase of developing their thinking, learning and collaborating abilities. The app will be made colorful so that it is fun &amp; enjoyable for the kids. Sugarizer activities will include things like, learning about music, drawing shapes and learning basic mathematical concepts through games like Cuisenaire rods. Existing educational apps available online are too difficult for kids &amp; the smallness of the icons of existing apps makes it difficult for the kids to play. Hence, our application can address these shortcomings. The goal of Primero1 is to allow kids to use Sugarizer as a powerful learning tool. We will ensure that the graphics used in the user interface are bright and of a suitable size, so that it can attract kids attention.</p>\n",

The SymPy mechanics module now has enough power and functionality to be a fully featured symbolic dynamics module. The PyDy package extends the SymPy output to the numerical domain for simulation, analyses, and visualization.\nThis project is about creating a parser that would translate Autolev code to SymPy code using the ANTLR framework. This would help users of Autolev to familiarize themselves with SymPy Mechanics. The project will also involve writing a lot of tests and documentation examples to demonstrate the functionality of the parser.</p>\n",

We provide this information, so people can better understand that they are a target, and understand the basic measures they can take to mitigate these threats.

All tools are specifically licensed open source. Organizations all over the world use our tools.</p>\n<p>Information - In addition to raising awareness, we provide details to better secure assets. Historically, information about attackers has been limited to the tools they use. We provide critical additional information, such as their motives in attacking, how they communicate, when they attack systems and their actions after compromising a system. We provide this service through our Know Your Enemy whitepapers and our periodic Scan of the Month challenges.</p>\n<p>The Honeynet Project uses GSoC as a incubator for new R&amp;D projects, and to recruit active new members.</p>\n",

That’s why malware targeting ARM is becoming an even bigger threat every day. On the other hand, it is still the x86 architecture for which most reverse engineering tools are developed. This Google Summer of Code (GSoC) project aims to add ARM support for both the dynamic analysis framework DRAKVUF and the virtual machine introspection (VMI) library libvmi. The idea is to base our project upon the result of an earlier GSoC project which added altp2m support for Xen on ARM. The altp2m subsystem defines different views on the guest’s physical memory and allows to dynamically switch among them. With altp2m and DRAKVUF we are able to build a stealthy VMI framework. In summary, the goal of the GSoC project is to add support for DRAKVUF for ARM and thus provide more options for reverse engineering on the ARM architecture.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>The Java Pathfinder project (JPF) was initially conceived and developed at NASA Ames Research Center in 1999. JPF was open sourced in April 2005 as one of the first ongoing NASA development projects to date, and it is now released under the Apache license, 2.0. JPF is a highly extensible Java virtual machine written in Java itself. It is used to create a variety of verification tools ranging from concurrency software model checkers to test case generators using symbolic execution. JPF is a research platform and a production tool at the same time. Although JPF has major contributions from companies and government agencies, our main user community is academic - there are ongoing collaborations with more than 20 universities worldwide. The JPF team for GSoC 2018 includes researchers from NASA Ames Research Center, Fujitsu Laboratories of America, Royal Institute of Technology - Sweden, Carnegie Mellon University , University of Minnesota, Stellenbosch University - ZA, Charles University - CZ, Teesside University - UK, University of Nebraska–Lincoln.</p>\n<p>JPF is designed to be extensible. There are well-defined extension mechanisms, directory structures and build procedures, which keep the core relatively stable and provide suitable, well separated testbeds for new ideas and alternative implementations. As a consequence, there exists many different extensions of JPF that capture different functionalities, including verification, testing, debugging, program repair and security analysis.</p>\n<p>JPF has been used for a variety of application domains and research topics such as verification of multi-threaded applications, graphical user interfaces, networking, and distributed applications. In addition to its continued presence in academia, JPF has matured enough to support verification of production code and frameworks such as Android. JPF is constantly being extended with support for verification of new types of properties and for new types of application domains.</p>\n",

We try to fix programs with pre-condition and post-condition written in separation logic. Given a program, we first run JSF to collect its post-state(p) by symbolic execution with the given pre-condition. Then we check if p entails the given post-condition(p'). If not, a bug is detected. Our approach to program repair has two main components: abduction and repair specification inference. First, we propose to infer the missing information to establish the post-condition through abduction using an existing solver. In particular, we infer a constraint f such that p * f is satisfied and p * f |-&gt; p'. Secondly, based on abduction, we symbolically execute the input program with the abduction in a backward manner in order to construct repair specifications at every line of the input program. These repair specifications help to infer valid Hoare-style triples with fix candidates.</p>\n",

Build tools help to automate those error-prone and daunt tasks with scripts that abstract those tasks. This proposal aims to modernize the build workflow from the Java PathFinder (JPF) project by migrating from Ant to Gradle. Gradle is a general purpose build system and uses Groovy, a JVM language, to create flexible and highly customizable build workflows. To achieve this goal, my strategy is to have a working Gradle build coexisting with the current Ant script. Ant targets will migrate to Gradle tasks in an incremental and iterative process. By the end of the program, is expected to have the Gradle support fully integrated into the main repository.</p>\n",

Users of ns-3 can construct simulations of computer networks using models of traffic generators, protocols such as TCP/IP, and devices and channels such as Wi-Fi and LTE, and analyze or visualize the results. Simulation plays a vital role in the research and education process, because of the ability for simulations to obtain reproducible results (particularly for wireless protocol design), scale to large networks, and study systems that have not yet been implemented. A particular emphasis in ns-3 is the high degree of realism in the models (including frameworks for using real application and kernel code) and integration of the tool with virtual machine environments and testbeds. Very large scale simulations are possible; simulations of hundreds of millions of nodes have been published.  ns-3 has been in development since 2005 and has been making regular releases since June 2008 (our last release was ns-3.27 in October 2017). The tool is in wide use; we provide statistics about the project on our web site (under the <a href=\"https://www.nsnam.org/overview/statistics/\" target=\"_blank\">Overview/Statistics page</a>), but in summary, we have a users mailing list (<a href=\"https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/ns-3-users\" target=\"_blank\">Google Groups forum</a>) of over 8000 members as of January 2018, averaging roughly 700 posts per month. Our developers' list has over 1500 subscribers, and the code base credits 220 authors, supported by about 10 active maintainers. ns-3 is operated as an open source project, originally funded with financial backing from three NSF grants and from the French government (and via help from Google Summer of Code and ESA Summer of Code in Space), but with most current contributions coming from interested researchers and students worldwide. We use a GPLv2 licensing model and heavily use mailing lists, and chat for code springs, but typically not other social media.</p>\n",

In order to provide such functionality, DCE integrates network simulator with custom Linux kernels like net-next-sim or net-next-nuse (LibOs). But net-next-nuse has not kept pace with latest versions of Linux kernel. This has been the major hindrance for DCE to use latest Linux kernel. An active alternative to LibOs is Linux Kernel Library (LKL), which provides similar features of LibOs and supports latest Linux kernel versions. In this project, LibOs will be replaced with LKL from DCE to support the networking stack of Linux. Currently, DCE uses custom implementation of libc; this makes it hard to maintain the code base. The another aspect of this project is to drop the custom libc and embed the musl libc in DCE.</p>\n",

      "description_html": "<p>Over years working in data visualization, we’ve sought to build tools that help designers craft sophisticated graphics, including systems such as Prefuse, Protovis and D3.js. However, in the grand scheme of things, “artisanal” visualizations hand-coded by skilled designers are the exception, not the rule. The vast majority of the world’s visualizations instead are produced using end-user applications such as spreadsheets and business intelligence tools. While valuable, these tools often fall short of fully supporting the iterative, interactive process of data analysis. Improved tools could help a larger swath of people create effective visualizations and better understand their data.\nThe goal of the Vega project is to promote an ecosystem of usable and interoperable visualization tools, supporting use cases ranging from exploratory data analysis to effective communication via custom visualization design.\nThis goal has led us to develop not a singular system, but rather a stack of tools for interactive data visualization. At the foundation of this stack is the Vega visualization grammar. Similar to how SQL provides a language for expressing database queries, Vega provides a declarative language for describing interactive visualizations with primitive building blocks such as data, transforms, marks, and event streams.  On top of Vega, Vega-Lite provides a concise language for rapidly generating statistical graphics to support data analysis.  With Vega and Vega-Lite, we have built a number of graphical user interfaces including the Voyager visualization tool, which blends manual and automated chart authoring to facilitate exploratory data analysis. \nTools from the Vega ecosystems have been adopted by the Jupyter/Python data science communities, Wikipedia, and leading tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Netflix, FitBit, and Twitter.</p>\n",

As Wine development continues, monitoring performance of different 3D titles can become a time consuming task with no standard results due to different gameplay each time a user play-tests a game. Some scripts that monitor performance already exist for some old titles. The purpose of this project is to pick some more recent games that offer a benchmark mode and write scripts that configure, run the benchmark and read the results. Newer titles are more of a challenge for today's systems (and Wine) and should provide us with clear results regarding any performance improvements between Wine revisions.</p>\n",

TLA+ is especially well suited for writing high-level specifications of concurrent and distributed systems.</p>\n<p>PlusCal is an algorithm language that, at first glance, looks like a typical tiny toy programming language. However, a PlusCal expression can be any TLA+ expression, which means anything that can be expressed with mathematics. This makes PlusCal much more expressive than any (real or toy) programming language. A PlusCal algorithm is translated into a TLA+ specification, to which the TLA+ tools can be applied.</p>\n<p>The principal TLA+ tools are the TLC model checker and TLAPS, the TLA+ proof system. All the tools are normally used from the Toolbox, an IDE (integrated development environment). Go to the TLA home page to find out more about TLA.</p>\n",

Our web-based data browser helps scientists make inferences and test hypotheses. Unique and important in the medical genomics research field, we allow users to combine their private data securely with public data using a decoupled server-client architecture. We are funded for the next 5 years by the National Cancer Institute as a genomic data visualization center to develop tools to visualize the largest compendium of cancer genomics data, the Genomic Data Commons. While we are funded nationally, our users are international, with only 40% of our traffic coming from within the United States. Last month we had over 3,500 users. We are committed to open-source software from the beginning and aim to make our code as reusable as possible (e.g. our <a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/static-interval-tree\" target=\"_blank\">static interval tree</a>, <a href=\"http://biojs.io/d/kaplan-meier\" target=\"_blank\">KM statistics</a> and <a href=\"http://xena.ucsc.edu/integration-icgc-portal/\" target=\"_blank\">ICGC plugin</a>).</p>\n<p>Students we mentor will have the benefit of being part of both a small, focused development team and also having access to the community resources of the larger <a href=\"https://ucscgenomics.soe.ucsc.edu/\" target=\"_blank\">UCSC Genomics Institute</a>, whose mission is to create advanced technologies and open-source genomics platforms to unravel evolutionary patterns, molecular processes and the underpinnings of disease. We are committed to working with students to ensure that they gain new knowledge and skills as well as contribute ideas and useful code to the project.</p>\n<p>We are interested in finding long-term collaborators and growing our development team. If you're interested in doing your Google Summer of Code project on cancer genetics, statistics, data visualization, database query, or functional programing, please contact us as soon as possible. We want to help all students submit the best possible proposal.</p>\n",

Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.</p>\n<h4>Overview</h4>\n<p>Currently in the web, modules are not fully adopted, and therefore we need tooling to help compile your module code into something that will work in the browser. webpack champions this by not only supporting CommonJS, AMD, RequireJS module systems, but also ECMAScript Modules (ESM).</p>\n<h4>What makes webpack unique?</h4>\n<p><strong>Extensibility</strong> webpack is built using an extensible event-driven architecture. This means that a majority of our code is Plugins that hook into a set of lifecycle events. This means that it is infinitely flexible and configurable. This architecture also lets us pivot very quickly. Plugins isolate functionality (and can even be used in your configuration), and allow us to add and drop new functionality without breaking the rest of the system.</p>\n<p><strong>Focused around Web Performance</strong> webpack revived a classic technique from Google Web Toolkit known as \"code splitting\". Code splitting let's developers write imperative instructions (as a part of their code), to split up their JavaScript bundles (at build time) into multiple pieces that can be loaded lazily.</p>\n<p><strong>Built in JavaScript</strong> webpack's configuration format, and architecture is all built and run on NodeJS. This means that anyone comfortable with JavaScript can break open our source code with a low level of entry to learn, contribute to, and improve.</p>\n<p><strong>Used at Scale</strong> webpack is used by companies like AirBnB, Microsoft, Housing.com, Flipkart, Alibaba, to build high performance, scaled web applications.</p>\n<p><strong>Community Owned</strong> webpack is not backed by a single organization, rather by its users, contributors, backers, sponsors, and shareholders.

As one of the most powerful module bundlers in recent year, Webpack team endeavors to enhance the bundling performance. In the latest version of Webpack 4, several improvements like new plugin system and parallelization with cache with UglifyJs have been implemented and accomplish a considerable performance enhancement. In this project, some cores and dependencies of Webpack are re-implemented in Rust, a low-level language, and WebAssembly binary is generated from them with the corresponding compilers. Some automation tools are used to help to convert existing JavaScript sources as well as future works to other languages. At the same time, backward compatibility of earlier Node.js versions will be maintained. It can be considered to be a significant performance enhancement with this project in the future Webpack release.</p>\n",

The GPU scheduler is now used by amdgpu and etnaviv (graphics driver for Vivante GPUs). It provides entities which allow userspace to push jobs into queues which are then executed by a hardware run queue. Now amdgpu has multiple identical hardware queues and we currently map round robin to the software queues provided by the GPU scheduler when those are created.

      "description_html": "<p>Zulip is a powerful, open source group chat application. It competes with Slack, IRC, Jabber, and dozens of other group chat tools designed to help teams (whether open source projects or companies) collaborate effectively. Zulip supports fast search, drag-and-drop file uploads, image previews, group private messages, configurable notifications, missed-message emails, markdown message rendering, and <a href=\"https://zulipchat.com/features\" target=\"_blank\">much more</a> -- essentially everything you might want.</p>\n<p>Unlike Slack, it’s open source and has a welcoming community of over 400 volunteer contributors. Unlike IRC/Jabber/etc., Zulip is a complete, modern application, with a nice web interface, mobile apps for iOS and Android, and desktop apps for Mac/Linux/Windows. And unlike all other popular group chat tools, Zulip is designed to make conversations more efficient through its unique threading system that helps teams manage large numbers of messages. In particular, Zulip makes it easy to have multiple conversations at the same time with the same groups of people, and easy to catch up on hundreds or thousands of messages quickly without missing anything important.</p>\n<p>Zulip is known for its <a href=\"http://zulip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/overview/contributing.html\" target=\"_blank\">extensive developer documentation</a> (100,000 words and growing!), code quality, and tooling, and thus is the ideal project to work on to learn how to build a high-quality web application.  Our goal in the GSoC program is for each successful student to grow into becoming the maintainer of a significant component of Zulip by the end of the program.</p>\n<p>As an organization, we value high-quality mentorship and high quality product -- you can expect to learn a lot how to make a large software project successful from disciplined code reviews by highly experienced engineers. Your GSoC experience with the Zulip project will be highly interactive (with daily chat checkins with mentors, experts, and other students), with a focus on teaching you the concepts and reasoning behind how Zulip is engineered and how to make it better.</p>\n",

The first project in my proposal is to solve this by working in our <strong>Swagger/OpenAPI docs</strong> until we have a 100% documented REST API. The relevant code examples will also be updated so we can provide fully functional scripts that show how to use it, as well as extending our Python bindings to cover all the endpoints the API provides.</p>\n<p>The role that API keys play is also quite important, especially now that our integrations system is becoming more and more robust and we have many different clients for interacting with Zulip.\nThat's why having <strong>multiple API keys per user</strong> could be very useful in terms of user account security and convenience. The second part of my project consists in implementing this feature in Zulip's backend, so normal users can have as many API keys they consider necessary (e.g. one per client), keeping authentication tokens isolated between applications.</p>\n",
